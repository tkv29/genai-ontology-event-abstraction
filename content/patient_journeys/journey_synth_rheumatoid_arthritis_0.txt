I first noticed the initial symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis on December 15, 2020. At that time, I experienced joint pain and stiffness, particularly in my hands and feet. The symptoms progressively worsened over the following weeks, making it challenging to perform my job as a software engineer effectively and to partake in activities with my family.

Concerned about these symptoms, I consulted my primary care physician in Andorra, who then referred me to a rheumatologist for further evaluation. Unfortunately, the diagnostic process was prolonged due to initially attributing the symptoms to overworking and stress. It was only after several months of persistent symptoms and extensive testing that I received a confirmed diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis in April 2021.

Upon diagnosis, my rheumatologist prescribed a combination of medications to manage my condition and alleviate the symptoms. Initially, I was prescribed Naproxen 250mg twice daily for pain and inflammation, which provided moderate relief. However, due to increasing joint pain and stiffness, the medication was later adjusted to Meloxicam 15mg once daily, offering better control over my symptoms.

In addition to Meloxicam, my rheumatologist introduced Methotrexate 10mg once a week to slow disease progression and reduce inflammation. The combination of Meloxicam and Methotrexate significantly improved my quality of life by minimizing joint pain and enhancing mobility. Regular follow-ups with my rheumatologist allowed for monitoring of the medication's effectiveness and potential side effects, ensuring optimal management of my Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Throughout this journey, I have relied on the expertise of my rheumatologist and primary care physician, who have been instrumental in providing personalized care and adjusting my medication regimen to meet my specific needs. Despite the challenges posed by Rheumatoid Arthritis, the prescribed medications have played a crucial role in enhancing my daily functioning and enabling me to balance work and family life more effectively.
