It was the winter of 2023 when my body first started showing signs of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Initially, it began with persistent joint pain in my hands and feet around 12/01/2023. As a busy single mother working as a nurse, I attributed the discomfort to the physical demands of my job. However, the pain soon intensified, making even simple tasks challenging.

Determined to seek answers, I consulted my primary care physician on 01/02/2023. After physical exams and blood tests, I was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis. Unfortunately, the road to diagnosis was not straightforward, as the symptoms were initially mistaken for general fatigue due to my hectic lifestyle.

Upon diagnosis, I was prescribed a combination of medications to manage the symptoms and slow the disease progression. Initially, I started with Ibuprofen to help alleviate the pain and inflammation. While it provided some relief initially, its effectiveness dwindled over time.

As the condition progressed, my healthcare team introduced Methotrexate on 02/15/2023 to target the underlying cause of Rheumatoid Arthritis. This medication brought significant improvement in managing my symptoms, reducing joint swelling and stiffness effectively. However, I experienced mild side effects like nausea and fatigue.

To complement Methotrexate, I was also prescribed Hydroxychloroquine on 03/10/2023. This medication played a key role in further reducing inflammation and improving my overall quality of life, allowing me to carry out my duties as a nurse and care for my children more comfortably.

Throughout my journey, I consulted rheumatologists and specialists who closely monitored my progress and adjusted the medication regimen as needed. Despite the challenges posed by Rheumatoid Arthritis, the tailored approach to medication management has been instrumental in helping me navigate daily life with more ease and comfort, ensuring that I can continue to prioritize my family and work with dedication.
