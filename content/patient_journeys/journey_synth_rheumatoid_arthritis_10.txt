On August 8, 2022, I, a 35-year-old single mother and nurse from Luxembourg, began experiencing the initial symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis. The first signs appeared as joint pain and stiffness in my fingers and toes, gradually progressing to swelling and difficulty in movement over the following weeks.

Seeking medical attention, I consulted my primary care physician, who initially prescribed Ibuprofen 400mg to manage the pain and inflammation. However, as the symptoms persisted and intensified, I was referred to a rheumatologist for further evaluation. It took a couple of months from the onset of symptoms to receive a definitive diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis, as the disease can be challenging to diagnose due to its varying presentation.

Upon diagnosis, my rheumatologist introduced a treatment plan to manage my condition. Initially, I was prescribed Methotrexate 15mg weekly, which helped in reducing the inflammation and slowing down the progression of the disease. However, due to some side effects, including nausea and fatigue, the dosage was adjusted to 10mg.

In addition to Methotrexate, my rheumatologist also prescribed Hydroxychloroquine Sulfate 200mg to further control inflammation. This combination proved effective in managing the symptoms and improving my quality of life. Regular check-ups with my rheumatologist helped monitor the progress and adjust the medications as needed.

As a healthcare professional myself, navigating Rheumatoid Arthritis while balancing work and family responsibilities has been challenging. However, with the support of my healthcare team and the prescribed medications, I have been able to effectively manage my symptoms and continue providing the care my patients deserve. The journey with Rheumatoid Arthritis has been a learning experience, highlighting the importance of timely diagnosis and personalized treatment plans tailored to individual needs.
