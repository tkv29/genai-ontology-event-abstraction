On 14/05/2020, as a 35-year-old single mother and nurse from Slovakia, I began experiencing joint pain and stiffness, especially in the mornings. Balancing work and caring for my children became increasingly challenging as the pain persisted. Concerned, I sought medical advice, leading to a series of consultations with various healthcare professionals.

Initially, my symptoms were attributed to overexertion at work. However, after persistent joint pain and morning stiffness continued, I was referred to a rheumatologist. It was a frustrating journey as my diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis wasn't immediate. Finally, on 25/07/2020, I received a confirmed diagnosis after several months of uncertainty and discomfort.

The healthcare team prescribed a range of medications to manage my symptoms. Initially, I was put on Ibuprofen to alleviate pain and inflammation. While it provided some relief, the symptoms persisted, prompting a switch to Naproxen on 15/08/2020. Naproxen proved more effective in managing my joint pain and stiffness, allowing me to navigate my demanding work schedule and caring for my children more comfortably.

In addition to Naproxen, I was started on Methotrexate on 05/09/2020 to address the underlying inflammation and slow disease progression. The combination of Naproxen and Methotrexate significantly improved my quality of life, reducing pain and enhancing mobility. Regular follow-ups with my rheumatologist helped refine the medication management, ensuring optimal control of Rheumatoid Arthritis symptoms.

Overall, the journey with Rheumatoid Arthritis has been challenging, but with the right medications and support from healthcare professionals, I have been able to effectively manage the condition, balancing work, and motherhood more comfortably.
