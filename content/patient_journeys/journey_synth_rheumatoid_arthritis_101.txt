I began experiencing the first signs of Rheumatoid Arthritis on May 30, 2023. Initially, I noticed swelling and pain in my joints, particularly in my hands and feet. As a 38-year-old software engineer juggling a demanding job and family responsibilities, these symptoms significantly impacted my daily life.

Seeking answers, I consulted my primary care physician, who referred me to a rheumatologist. The road to diagnosis was challenging, with a few misdiagnoses causing delays in receiving the correct treatment. Finally, after multiple tests and consultations, I was formally diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis in July 2023.

The healthcare professionals I consulted included my primary care physician, a rheumatologist, and a physical therapist. The treatment plan prescribed for managing my Rheumatoid Arthritis symptoms included a combination of medications:

- Initially, I was prescribed Ibuprofen to alleviate pain and inflammation. While it provided some relief, the effects were short-lived.
- To address the progressive nature of the condition, my rheumatologist introduced Methotrexate in August 2023. This medication helped in slowing down the disease progression, leading to improved joint function.
- As Methotrexate alone wasn't sufficient to manage my symptoms effectively, my treatment plan was adjusted in September 2023 to include Naproxen. This combination therapy further reduced inflammation and pain, allowing me to better cope with my daily responsibilities.

Overall, the medications prescribed, particularly the combination of Methotrexate and Naproxen, have been instrumental in managing my Rheumatoid Arthritis symptoms. While challenges persist, including balancing work and family life, the treatment regimen has significantly improved my quality of life and enabled me to continue providing for my family while seeing my children grow and thrive.
