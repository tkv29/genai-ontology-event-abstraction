On December 21, 2021, I started experiencing joint pain, stiffness, and swelling, particularly in my hands and feet. As a construction worker and single father, these symptoms severely impacted my ability to work and care for my children.

After struggling for a few weeks, I consulted my family doctor on January 10, 2022, who suspected Rheumatoid Arthritis and referred me to a rheumatologist. However, due to a backlog in appointments, I had to wait until February 15, 2022, for the specialist visit.

During this time, the pain intensified, but I was only prescribed Ibuprofen 400mg as needed for pain relief, which provided minimal relief. The delay in diagnosis left me feeling frustrated and helpless.

Upon seeing the rheumatologist, I was officially diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis on February 15, 2022. The specialist prescribed Methotrexate 15mg weekly and Naproxen 250mg twice daily to manage my symptoms. Methotrexate proved to be effective in reducing joint inflammation and pain, while Naproxen helped with overall pain relief.

As my condition progressed, my medication regimen was adjusted on April 10, 2022, to include Prednisone 10mg daily to manage flare-ups. The combination of Methotrexate, Naproxen, and Prednisone significantly improved my quality of life, allowing me to work and care for my children more effectively.

Throughout this journey, I consulted a family doctor, rheumatologist, and a pharmacist who played crucial roles in managing my Rheumatoid Arthritis. Their expertise and support have been instrumental in helping me navigate this challenging condition and continue providing for my family despite the obstacles it presents.
