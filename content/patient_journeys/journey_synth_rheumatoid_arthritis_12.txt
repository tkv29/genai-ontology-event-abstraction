I first noticed the initial symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis on the 13th of January 2021. The joint pain and stiffness in my hands and feet were debilitating, especially after my long shifts at the hospital. As a single mother of two, it was challenging to balance work and taking care of my children, but the joy they bring kept me going.

The process of getting diagnosed was not immediate. My symptoms were initially brushed off as fatigue from work, leading to a delay in seeking proper medical attention. It was only after persistent pain and swelling that I consulted a rheumatologist in February 2021, who confirmed the diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis after blood tests and imaging.

Upon diagnosis, I was prescribed a combination of medications to manage my symptoms. Initially, I was started on Ibuprofen to reduce inflammation and pain. While it provided some relief, the effects were short-lived. In March 2021, my rheumatologist introduced Methotrexate to control the progression of the disease. This medication significantly improved my joint pain and swelling, allowing me to function better at work and home.

As my condition progressed, in June 2021, Azathioprine was added to my treatment regimen to further suppress my overactive immune system. This medication, along with Methotrexate, has been effective in preventing flare-ups and improving my overall quality of life. Regular follow-ups with my rheumatologist have been crucial in adjusting the dosages and monitoring my response to the medications.

Throughout my journey with Rheumatoid Arthritis, the healthcare professionals I consulted, including my rheumatologist and primary care physician, played a vital role in managing my condition. Their expertise and guidance in selecting the right medications have been instrumental in helping me cope with the challenges posed by this chronic illness.
