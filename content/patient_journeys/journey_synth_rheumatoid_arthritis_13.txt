I first noticed swelling and pain in my joints on March 8, 2023, which gradually worsened over a couple of weeks. As a 35-year-old construction worker in Azerbaijan, this discomfort made my job increasingly challenging. Despite my initial reluctance, I visited a local clinic on March 20, 2023, seeking answers to these persistent symptoms.

The diagnostic process was lengthy and frustrating. Initially, the healthcare provider suspected it might be related to overuse due to my job demands. However, as the pain persisted and spread to multiple joints, further tests were conducted. It wasn't until April 10, 2023, that I received a confirmed diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Upon diagnosis, the rheumatologist prescribed an aggressive treatment plan to manage my symptoms. I started with a combination of Ibuprofen and Naproxen to alleviate the inflammation and pain in my joints. While these medications offered some relief initially, the progression of the disease necessitated more robust interventions.

As my symptoms persisted, the healthcare team introduced Methotrexate into my treatment regimen on April 25, 2023. This medication played a crucial role in slowing down the disease progression and reducing the severity of my symptoms, allowing me to continue working and providing for my family.

Throughout this journey, the rheumatologist closely monitored my response to the medications, adjusting dosages and introducing new drugs like Leflunomide in August 2023 to enhance the control of my Rheumatoid Arthritis. The combination of Methotrexate and Leflunomide proved to be highly effective in managing my symptoms, significantly improving my quality of life and ability to work.

I am immensely grateful for the dedication and expertise of the healthcare professionals involved in my care, especially my rheumatologist, whose guidance and support have been invaluable in my battle against Rheumatoid Arthritis. Despite the challenges, my family continues to be my source of strength and motivation, driving me to persist in managing this condition effectively.
