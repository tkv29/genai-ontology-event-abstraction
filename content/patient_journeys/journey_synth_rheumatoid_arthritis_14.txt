I first experienced symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis on 03/10/2022, with persistent joint pain, swelling, and stiffness, making it challenging to carry out my duties as a nurse and care for my children. Despite initially attributing it to work-related stress and fatigue, the symptoms worsened over the following weeks, prompting me to seek medical attention.

After consulting with my primary care physician, I was referred to a rheumatologist for further evaluation. The process of getting diagnosed was prolonged due to the complexity of my symptoms, leading to initial misdiagnoses of overexertion and a possible musculoskeletal injury. It wasn't until 04/25/2022 that I received a confirmed diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis after undergoing extensive blood tests and imaging studies.

Following my diagnosis, I was prescribed a combination of medications to manage my symptoms and slow down the progression of the disease. The healthcare professionals I consulted included my rheumatologist and a pain management specialist who closely monitored my condition.

The medications prescribed for managing my Rheumatoid Arthritis symptoms included:
- Methotrexate: Initially prescribed on 04/25/2022, Methotrexate proved effective in reducing joint inflammation and pain, although it caused some mild nausea.
- Prednisone: Introduced on 05/10/2022 as a short-term solution for severe flares, Prednisone provided rapid relief but came with mood swings and increased appetite.
- Hydroxychloroquine: Added to my regimen on 06/01/2022, Hydroxychloroquine helped improve overall joint function and reduce fatigue.

Despite the side effects, the medications significantly improved my quality of life by alleviating pain and enhancing mobility, allowing me to continue working and caring for my family. Regular follow-ups with my healthcare team ensured adjustments to the treatment plan as needed to better manage my Rheumatoid Arthritis symptoms.
