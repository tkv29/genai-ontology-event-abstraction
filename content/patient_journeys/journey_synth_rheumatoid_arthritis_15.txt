I started experiencing the first symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis on 27/02/2022. Initially, I noticed persistent joint pain and stiffness, especially in my hands and feet. As a nurse juggling a demanding job and family responsibilities, these symptoms quickly began to impact my daily life.

After struggling with increasing discomfort for several weeks, I finally sought medical help and was referred to a rheumatologist. The diagnosis process was challenging, with initial confusion due to the overlapping symptoms with other conditions. There were some delays in reaching a definite diagnosis, as some doctors initially suspected it might be related to overworking or stress.

Following a series of tests and consultations, I was officially diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis on 15/05/2022. The rheumatologist prescribed a combination of medications to manage my symptoms and improve my quality of life. 

I was prescribed Methotrexate initially, which helped to reduce inflammation and joint pain significantly. However, due to some side effects, my medication was switched to Hydroxychloroquine sulfate along with Prednisone to manage flare-ups. These medications proved effective in controlling the progression of the disease and alleviating my symptoms.

Throughout my journey, I consulted with rheumatologists, orthopedic specialists, and my general practitioner to monitor my condition and adjust the medication regimen as needed. Their expertise and support have been pivotal in managing my Rheumatoid Arthritis effectively.

Despite the challenges of living with this chronic condition, the medications prescribed have played a crucial role in improving my quality of life and allowing me to continue my work as a nurse and care for my family.
