On the 27th of March 2021, I, a 35-year-old accountant from Cyprus, began experiencing persistent joint pain, swelling, and stiffness, particularly in my hands and feet. Ignoring initial discomfort, I attributed it to stress from work and disregarded seeking medical attention. As weeks passed, the pain intensified, affecting my ability to perform daily tasks efficiently.

Feeling increasingly concerned, I consulted my primary care physician, who suspected Rheumatoid Arthritis due to the symmetrical joint involvement and referred me to a rheumatologist. However, due to a backlog in appointments, I faced a delay in consultation.

After numerous blood tests, imaging scans, and thorough physical examinations, I received an official diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis in late May. The initial treatment plan included Methotrexate and Naproxen. Methotrexate, taken weekly, proved effective in managing the inflammation and slowing disease progression. However, I experienced gastrointestinal side effects, leading to a switch to Ibuprofen for pain relief.

As my symptoms fluctuated, the rheumatologist introduced Hydroxychloroquine in combination with Prednisone to further control the disease activity. Hydroxychloroquine significantly improved my joint pain and swelling, providing much-needed relief. Unfortunately, Prednisone's long-term use caused weight gain and mood swings.

Consulting with my healthcare team regularly, adjustments were made to balance medication efficacy and side effects. In December, Leflunomide replaced Methotrexate, leading to better symptom control with minimal adverse reactions.

Despite the challenges of managing Rheumatoid Arthritis, the collaborative efforts of my healthcare professionals and the tailored medication regimen have significantly improved my quality of life. While there have been hurdles along the way, I continue to prioritize my health to better care for my family and fulfill my professional responsibilities.
