On August 25, 2021, I, a 35-year-old accountant and single mother from Italy, began experiencing joint pain, stiffness, and swelling, which gradually worsened over a few weeks, impairing my ability to work and care for my children effectively. Concerned, I sought medical advice. Despite initially attributing the symptoms to stress and overwork, the persistence and intensity led me to further consultations.

After enduring misdiagnoses ranging from general fatigue to overexertion, a rheumatologist diagnosed me with Rheumatoid Arthritis on October 10, 2021. The relief of finally understanding the cause of my suffering was overshadowed by the overwhelming treatment regimen that ensued.

I was prescribed multiple medications to manage my symptoms and halt disease progression. Initially, I started with Naproxen to alleviate pain and inflammation. While it provided some relief, the progression of my RA necessitated the addition of Methotrexate on November 2, 2021. This combination significantly improved my joint health and functionality, allowing me to resume work and engage with my children more actively. However, the side effects of Methotrexate, including nausea and fatigue, posed additional challenges.

The complexity of managing Rheumatoid Arthritis led me to consult various healthcare professionals, including my primary care physician, rheumatologist, and a physical therapist, each playing a crucial role in my treatment journey.

Navigating life as a working single mother with RA has been demanding, but with the right medications and support, I am finding a balance that allows me to prioritize both my family and my health.
