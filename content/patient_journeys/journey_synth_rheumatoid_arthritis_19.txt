As a 35-year-old nurse from Cyprus, my journey with Rheumatoid Arthritis began with the sudden onset of symptoms on 23/03/2021. Initially, I experienced joint pain and swelling in my hands and feet, accompanied by morning stiffness that made it challenging to get out of bed.

The process of getting diagnosed was lengthy and challenging. I consulted multiple healthcare professionals, including my primary care physician, who initially suspected it might be related to overexertion from my work as a nurse. However, as my symptoms persisted and intensified, I was referred to a rheumatologist. It took several tests and appointments before I received a confirmed diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis, ruling out other conditions like osteoarthritis.

Upon diagnosis, my rheumatologist prescribed a combination of medications to manage my symptoms and slow down disease progression. Initially, I was prescribed Ibuprofen 200mg to help with pain and inflammation. While it provided some relief, the effectiveness was limited, especially during long shifts at the hospital.

As my symptoms persisted, the rheumatologist introduced Methotrexate, which proved more effective in managing inflammation and joint pain. However, due to certain side effects, the dosage needed adjustment over time to find the right balance between symptom control and managing the medication's impact on my overall well-being.

Over the following months, additional medications were added to my treatment plan, including Hydroxychloroquine and Prednisone, aimed at further controlling inflammation and disease activity. Each medication brought its own set of side effects and challenges, requiring regular monitoring and adjustments by my healthcare team.

Despite the ups and downs of managing Rheumatoid Arthritis, the support of my healthcare professionals, along with the tailored medication regimen, has been crucial in helping me navigate my daily responsibilities as a nurse and caregiver to my children. Balancing work, family, and self-care remains a constant challenge, but with the right medications and support, I strive to face each day with strength and determination.
