I first noticed symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis on 21/08/2023, experiencing joint pain, swelling, and stiffness, particularly in my hands and feet. As a 35-year-old nurse and single mother, managing these symptoms while juggling work and childcare became increasingly challenging.

Seeking a diagnosis, I consulted my primary care physician who referred me to a rheumatologist. However, there were initial misdiagnoses suggesting common joint issues due to my physically demanding job. It wasn't until 10/09/2023 that I received a confirmed diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis after thorough blood tests and imaging.

Following the diagnosis, I was prescribed a combination of medications to manage my symptoms effectively. Initially, I was started on Naproxen 500mg twice daily for pain relief, which provided moderate relief but did not fully alleviate my symptoms. Subsequently, my rheumatologist introduced Methotrexate 15mg weekly, which significantly improved joint inflammation and pain, allowing me to function better at work and home.

As my condition progressed, I was also prescribed Hydroxychloroquine 200mg daily to further control inflammation. This addition brought a notable improvement in my overall mobility and reduced the frequency of flare-ups, contributing to a better quality of life.

Throughout my journey, I consulted with a team of healthcare professionals, including my primary care physician, rheumatologist, and a physiotherapist, who collectively played a crucial role in managing my Rheumatoid Arthritis effectively.

Overall, the combination of Naproxen, Methotrexate, and Hydroxychloroquine has been instrumental in managing my symptoms and allowing me to continue my work as a nurse and care for my children. The medications have significantly improved my quality of life, helping me navigate the daily challenges of living with Rheumatoid Arthritis.
