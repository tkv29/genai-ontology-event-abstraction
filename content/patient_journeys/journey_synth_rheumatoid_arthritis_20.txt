On October 5, 2022, I, a 35-year-old software engineer from Andorra, started experiencing the initial symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis. It began with persistent joint pain in my fingers and wrists, accompanied by morning stiffness that made it challenging to start my day. As the days passed, the pain intensified, spreading to my knees and ankles, making it difficult to perform routine tasks both at work and at home.

The process of getting diagnosed was not immediate. Initially, I attributed the symptoms to excessive computer use at work, but as the pain persisted and my mobility decreased, I consulted a rheumatologist on October 20, 2022. Despite some difficulty in pinpointing the exact cause due to overlapping symptoms with other conditions, the rheumatologist confirmed the diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis on November 5, 2022, ruling out other potential conditions like osteoarthritis.

Upon diagnosis, the healthcare professional prescribed a combination of medications to manage my Rheumatoid Arthritis symptoms effectively. Initially, on November 10, 2022, I was started on Ibuprofen 200mg twice daily for pain relief and inflammation reduction. However, as the disease progressed, the doctor introduced Methotrexate on December 1, 2022, to slow the progression and reduce joint damage. This medication proved to be highly effective in managing the symptoms and improving my quality of life.

Throughout my journey with Rheumatoid Arthritis, I regularly consulted with my rheumatologist for check-ups and adjustments to medication dosages. The collaborative approach between myself and the healthcare professional, along with the prescribed medications, has significantly contributed to the management of my condition and allowed me to continue balancing my demanding work responsibilities with family life effectively.
