On January 23, 2020, as a 35-year-old attorney and single parent in Lithuania, I started experiencing debilitating joint pain, swelling, and fatigue. Initially attributed to stress, the symptoms persisted and worsened, impacting my ability to work and care for my children. 

After months of persistent symptoms, numerous medical consultations, and tests ruling out other conditions, I was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis in June 2020. The road to diagnosis was challenging, with misdiagnoses of general joint pain and overwork-related issues causing delays in getting the correct treatment.

From the time of diagnosis, I was prescribed an intensive medication regimen to manage my symptoms and slow down disease progression. Initially, I was put on a combination of Naproxen, Methotrexate, and Hydroxychloroquine. Naproxen helped with pain relief, Methotrexate was effective in reducing inflammation, and Hydroxychloroquine aided in controlling the autoimmune response.

As the disease progressed, and my symptoms fluctuated, my rheumatologist adjusted my treatment plan. I was then prescribed a biologic DMARD called Tofacitinib along with Prednisone during disease flares. Tofacitinib significantly improved my joint pain and stiffness, allowing me to function better at work and home. Prednisone helped manage acute flares effectively.

Throughout my journey, I consulted with rheumatologists, physiotherapists, and pain management specialists regularly to monitor my progress and adjust my treatment as needed. The medications prescribed played a crucial role in managing my Rheumatoid Arthritis symptoms, allowing me to continue pursuing my career and caring for my family effectively. Each medication had its own role in controlling pain, inflammation, and disease progression, ultimately improving my quality of life despite the challenges of living with a chronic condition.
