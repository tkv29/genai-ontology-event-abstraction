On 14th March 2020, I, a 35-year-old nurse from Croatia, started experiencing crippling joint pain and stiffness. These symptoms persisted and gradually worsened, affecting my daily life and work. Despite my dedication to caring for others, the fatigue and discomfort became overwhelming.

Concerned about my health, I consulted a rheumatologist on 28th April 2020. After a series of tests and examinations, I received the life-altering diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Unfortunately, the road to diagnosis was not straightforward. Initially, my symptoms were attributed to overwork and stress, leading to a delay in seeking specialized medical help. This delay made my condition more challenging to manage.

Following the diagnosis, my healthcare team prescribed a combination of medications to alleviate my symptoms and slow the progression of Rheumatoid Arthritis:

- **Methotrexate** (MTX): Initiated on 30th April 2020, MTX helped reduce joint pain and inflammation significantly. Regular blood tests monitored its impact on liver function.

- **Prednisone**: Prescribed on 15th May 2020 to manage severe flare-ups, Prednisone provided quick relief but had side effects that required careful monitoring.

- **Hydroxychloroquine sulfate**: Added to my regimen on 20th June 2020, this medication helped improve overall joint mobility and reduce morning stiffness.

- **Leflunomide**: Introduced on 5th August 2020, Leflunomide played a crucial role in slowing the progression of joint damage.

Despite the efficacy of these medications, some adjustments were necessary due to side effects and changes in my symptoms. Regular consultations with my rheumatologist, physiotherapist, and pharmacist were crucial in fine-tuning my treatment plan.

Through this challenging journey, my beloved dog provided the comfort and companionship I needed after exhausting shifts. Despite the hurdles, the right medications and supportive healthcare team have allowed me to continue caring for others while managing my Rheumatoid Arthritis effectively.
