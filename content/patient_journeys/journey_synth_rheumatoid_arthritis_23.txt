I first experienced symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis on April 4, 2023, with persistent joint pain in my hands and feet. As a 35-year-old graphic designer from the UK, these symptoms significantly impacted my work and daily life. The pain gradually worsened over the following weeks, leading me to seek medical help.

After consulting with my general practitioner on April 20, 2023, and discussing my symptoms, I was referred to a rheumatologist for further evaluation. The process of getting diagnosed was challenging, with initial uncertainty and a couple of misdiagnoses suggesting other conditions. It wasn't until May 10, 2023, that I received a confirmed diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Following the diagnosis, I was prescribed a combination of medications to manage my symptoms effectively. Initially, I was started on Ibuprofen 200mg twice daily for pain relief and inflammation control. While Ibuprofen provided some relief, the effectiveness waned over time, leading to a switch to Naproxen 250mg daily on May 25, 2023.

Naproxen proved to be more effective in managing my symptoms, allowing me to work with reduced discomfort and better mobility. Additionally, on June 5, 2023, my rheumatologist introduced Methotrexate 10mg weekly to target the underlying causes of Rheumatoid Arthritis. The combination of Naproxen and Methotrexate significantly improved my quality of life, reducing pain and inflammation.

Throughout this journey, I consulted with my general practitioner for initial assessments, followed by a rheumatologist for a confirmed diagnosis and specialized treatment. The support and guidance from these healthcare professionals were crucial in managing my Rheumatoid Arthritis effectively.

Overall, the medications, including Naproxen and Methotrexate, have played a vital role in alleviating my symptoms, allowing me to focus on my career and daily activities despite living with this chronic condition.
