On January 13, 2023, I, a 35-year-old single mother from North Macedonia, started experiencing the first signs of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Initially, it began with persistent joint pain in my fingers, followed by morning stiffness and swelling in my wrists over the next few weeks. The increasing discomfort triggered concern, prompting me to seek medical advice.

Navigating the healthcare system, I consulted my primary care physician, who suspected Rheumatoid Arthritis. However, the road to an official diagnosis was fraught with challenges, including a misdiagnosis of general joint pain and delays due to varying test results. It wasn't until March 5, 2023, that a rheumatologist confirmed my condition after thorough examinations and blood work.

Following the diagnosis, my treatment plan included a regimen of medications to manage my symptoms. Initially, I was prescribed Naproxen 250mg twice a day, which moderately relieved my joint pain but didn't address the swelling effectively. Subsequently, on March 20, 2023, my rheumatologist introduced Methotrexate 10mg once a week, which significantly reduced the inflammation and improved my mobility.

As I continued my journey with Rheumatoid Arthritis, in April 2023, my Methotrexate dosage was adjusted to 15mg once a week to achieve better disease control. While the medication initially caused mild nausea, these side effects subsided with time, allowing me to benefit from its overall effectiveness in managing my symptoms. Additionally, I was recommended to take Folic Acid supplements to counteract the potential side effects of Methotrexate.

Throughout my treatment, I maintained close communication with my rheumatologist, scheduling regular follow-up appointments to monitor my progress and adjust medications as needed. Overall, the combined approach of Naproxen and Methotrexate has significantly improved my quality of life, enabling me to better fulfill my responsibilities as a nurse and mother while managing the challenges of Rheumatoid Arthritis effectively.
