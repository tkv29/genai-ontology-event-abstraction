On March 3, 2022, I began experiencing persistent joint pain, swelling, and stiffness, particularly in my hands and knees. As a 35-year-old single father with a demanding career, these symptoms significantly impacted my ability to work efficiently and care for my children.

After weeks of worsening symptoms, I consulted my primary care physician on April 15, 2022. Initially, my symptoms were attributed to stress and overwork. However, the pain persisted, leading to further investigations.

Finally, on May 20, 2022, I was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis by a rheumatologist after a series of blood tests, imaging studies, and a physical examination. Unfortunately, the road to diagnosis was prolonged due to initial misattributions of my symptoms.

Following the diagnosis, the rheumatologist prescribed a combination of medications to manage my symptoms effectively:

- May 20, 2022: I was initially prescribed Naproxen to alleviate pain and inflammation. The medication provided moderate relief but was soon complemented with Methotrexate on June 1, 2022, to target the underlying cause of my Rheumatoid Arthritis.

- June 15, 2022: Due to inadequate response, Hydroxychloroquine was added to my regimen to enhance disease control. This combination significantly improved my symptoms and mobility, allowing me to better balance work and family life.

Throughout this journey, I consulted with my primary care physician, the rheumatologist who diagnosed me, and a specialized pharmacist who provided guidance on medication management and potential side effects.

Overall, the medications prescribed have played a crucial role in managing my Rheumatoid Arthritis symptoms, enhancing my quality of life, and enabling me to navigate the challenges of being a single parent and a dedicated lawyer.
