On 27/08/2023, I, a 35-year-old software engineer from Greece, first experienced the initial symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis: joint pain, swelling, and stiffness, particularly in my hands and feet. Over the following weeks, the symptoms worsened, affecting my ability to work and engage in daily activities. Concerned, I sought medical advice.

After multiple consultations with healthcare professionals, I was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis on 15/09/2023, following extensive blood tests and imaging studies. The road to diagnosis was challenging, with initial misdiagnoses of "overworked joints" leading to delays in receiving appropriate treatment.

To manage my Rheumatoid Arthritis, I was prescribed a combination of medications tailored to my condition. Initially, I was started on Naproxen 250mg twice a day to reduce inflammation and pain. While it provided some relief, the effectiveness waned over time, prompting a switch to Methotrexate on 05/10/2023. Methotrexate, combined with Prednisone for flare-ups, proved more effective in controlling my symptoms and improving my quality of life.

As my condition progressed, my healthcare team introduced Hydroxychloroquine sulfate on 20/10/2023 to further manage inflammation. This addition significantly reduced joint pain and swelling, allowing me to better manage my work-life balance. Regular follow-ups with rheumatologists and monitoring of medication effects have been crucial in managing my Rheumatoid Arthritis effectively.

Through a combination of Methotrexate, Prednisone, and Hydroxychloroquine sulfate, I have found a balance that enables me to continue working, supporting my family, and enjoying time with my loved ones despite the challenges posed by this chronic condition.
