On 07/06/2022, I started experiencing excruciating joint pain, primarily in my hands and knees. As a dedicated software engineer, these symptoms immediately impacted my productivity. Initially attributing it to overwork, I ignored the persistent discomfort until it affected simple tasks like typing and playing with my kids.

Concerned, I consulted my family doctor who suspected Rheumatoid Arthritis. However, due to atypical symptoms for someone as young as I was, there were delays in reaching a definitive diagnosis. Several tests and consultations later, on 08/20/2022, I was officially diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis.

The treatment journey commenced with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like Ibuprofen to alleviate pain and inflammation. While providing some relief, the effectiveness waned over time. The gradual introduction of disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) like Methotrexate significantly improved my symptoms. However, its side effects required close monitoring.

As my condition progressed, my rheumatologist introduced Biologic DMARDs such as Tofacitinib on 10/15/2022. The targeted approach of these medications provided a breakthrough in managing my Rheumatoid Arthritis. Supplementary medications like Prednisone were prescribed during flare-ups for short-term relief.

Regular consultations with my rheumatologist and occasional visits to a pain management specialist were crucial in monitoring my progress and adjusting medications. Through this personalized approach, a balance was achieved between managing my symptoms and maintaining a semblance of normalcy in my work and family life.

Overall, the journey with Rheumatoid Arthritis has been challenging, but with the right medications and healthcare guidance, I have learned to navigate this chronic condition effectively.
