On 17th March 2020, I started experiencing persistent joint pain, swelling, and stiffness, primarily in my hands and feet. As a busy single mother and nurse, these symptoms significantly hampered my ability to work and care for my children. 

The process of getting diagnosed was challenging. Initially, my symptoms were attributed to overexertion at work. However, after several months of worsening pain and fatigue, I sought a second opinion. In September 2020, I was finally diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis after extensive blood tests and imaging.

Since my diagnosis, I have been prescribed a combination of medications to manage my symptoms. Initially, I was started on Naproxen 250mg twice daily, which provided some relief but did not completely alleviate the pain and swelling. In addition to Naproxen, my rheumatologist introduced Methotrexate 10mg weekly to control the progression of the disease. This combination proved to be more effective in managing my symptoms, although I experienced mild nausea as a side effect of Methotrexate.

As my condition progressed, my healthcare team added Hydroxychloroquine 200mg daily to my treatment regimen, which further improved joint pain and stiffness. However, I still struggled with flare-ups, leading to the inclusion of Prednisone 5mg as a short-term solution during exacerbations. 

Throughout this journey, I consulted with rheumatologists, general practitioners, and physical therapists to manage my Rheumatoid Arthritis effectively. Regular monitoring of side effects and adjusting medication dosages have been crucial in maintaining my quality of life while balancing work and motherhood responsibilities. Despite the challenges, I am grateful for the care I have received and the medications that have significantly improved my symptoms and allowed me to continue providing for my family.
