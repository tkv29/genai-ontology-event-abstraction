On November 3, 2023, I, a 35-year-old architect from Germany, began experiencing joint pain, stiffness, and swelling in my hands and knees. Initially, I attributed these symptoms to overwork and stress due to my demanding job. However, as the discomfort persisted and even worsened, I sought medical attention.

After consulting my primary care physician, I was referred to a rheumatologist. The diagnostic process was challenging, with a few possible misdiagnoses along the way, including osteoarthritis. It wasn't until December 15, 2023, nearly six weeks after my initial symptoms appeared, that I received a confirmed diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Following the diagnosis, my rheumatologist prescribed a combination of medications to help manage my symptoms and slow disease progression. Initially, I was started on Ibuprofen 200mg three times a day for pain relief. While it provided some relief, the effectiveness was limited.

In January 2024, my treatment plan was adjusted, and I was prescribed Methotrexate once a week. This medication was more potent in controlling inflammation and joint damage, significantly improving my symptoms. However, due to certain side effects, including nausea and fatigue, my rheumatologist introduced Folic Acid supplements to mitigate these issues.

In addition to Methotrexate, I also began taking Naproxen 500mg as needed for breakthrough pain. The combination of Methotrexate and Naproxen proved to be effective in managing both the pain and inflammation associated with Rheumatoid Arthritis. I found that the medications allowed me to continue working and engaging in activities with my family with reduced discomfort.

Throughout my journey with Rheumatoid Arthritis, I consulted with my rheumatologist regularly to monitor my response to the medications and make necessary adjustments to the treatment plan. Despite the challenges of living with this chronic condition, the prescribed medications have significantly improved my quality of life and allowed me to continue pursuing my passion for architecture while balancing family responsibilities.
