On March 24, 2023, as a 38-year-old software engineer from Estonia, I began experiencing joint pain, stiffness, and swelling, primarily in my fingers and wrists. Initially dismissed as work-related strain, the symptoms persisted, prompting a visit to my family doctor in early April. After several tests and consultations, I received a diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis in late May.

Initially, I was prescribed Naproxen 500mg to manage the inflammation and pain. While it provided some relief, the symptoms persisted, leading to the addition of Methotrexate in June. This combination helped improve my mobility and reduce the swelling significantly. However, by August, the disease activity increased, necessitating a switch to Leflunomide, which proved more effective in managing my symptoms.

In October, due to ongoing joint damage, my rheumatologist introduced Tofacitinib in combination with Leflunomide. This new regimen offered better control over the disease activity and significantly improved my quality of life. Despite occasional side effects like gastrointestinal discomfort and fatigue, the benefits outweighed the drawbacks.

Throughout this journey, I consulted with a team of healthcare professionals, including rheumatologists, physiotherapists, and a nutritionist, to manage the disease comprehensively. The support and expertise of my medical team have been invaluable in adapting my treatment plan and addressing any concerns promptly.

In conclusion, the combination of medications, including Naproxen, Methotrexate, Leflunomide, and Tofacitinib, has been crucial in managing my Rheumatoid Arthritis symptoms effectively. While the road has been challenging, the right medications and ongoing medical support have made a significant difference in my ability to continue my work and be present for my family.
