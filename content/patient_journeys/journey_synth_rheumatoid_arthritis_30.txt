I first noticed the initial symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis in early July 2022. What started as persistent joint pain, especially in my hands and feet, quickly progressed to swelling and morning stiffness. By the end of the month, the symptoms had become increasingly debilitating, affecting my ability to work and engage in daily activities.

Seeking answers, I consulted my primary care physician in August 2022. After a series of blood tests and imaging, I was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis in September 2022. However, the road to diagnosis was not straightforward, as the initial symptoms were mistaken for general joint pain due to stress from work.

Upon diagnosis, I was prescribed a treatment plan to manage my symptoms. Initially, I was given Ibuprofen to alleviate pain and inflammation. While it provided temporary relief, the effectiveness diminished over time, prompting my rheumatologist to switch me to Naproxen in November 2022. Although Naproxen helped manage the pain better, its efficacy fluctuated, and I experienced gastrointestinal side effects.

In January 2023, my rheumatologist introduced Methotrexate as a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD). The Methotrexate, combined with Prednisone for short-term relief during flare-ups, significantly improved my symptoms and slowed disease progression. However, the side effects, including nausea and hair loss, posed challenges.

As my condition required more targeted management, in April 2023, my rheumatologist prescribed Tofacitinib to further control inflammation. The switch to Tofacitinib was a game-changer, providing substantial relief with minimal side effects, enhancing my quality of life and allowing me to navigate work and family responsibilities more effectively.

Throughout my journey, I consulted with a team of healthcare professionals, including rheumatologists, general practitioners, and physiotherapists, who played crucial roles in tailoring my treatment plan. Despite the hurdles and adjustments, finding the right combination of medications has been pivotal in managing my Rheumatoid Arthritis symptoms and regaining a sense of balance amidst life's chaos.
