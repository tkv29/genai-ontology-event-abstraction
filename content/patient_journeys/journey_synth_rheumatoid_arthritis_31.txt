I am a 35-year-old lawyer from Montenegro. I first experienced symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis on February 20, 2023. What began as joint pain and stiffness gradually progressed, making it challenging to carry out daily tasks.

The process of getting diagnosed was not immediate. My initial visit to the doctor included blood tests and imaging. There were misdiagnoses along the way, with some healthcare providers attributing my symptoms to overwork or other temporary causes. It wasn't until June 2023, after consulting with a rheumatologist, that I received a confirmed diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Upon diagnosis, my healthcare team prescribed a combination of medications to manage my symptoms effectively. Initially, I was started on Ibuprofen 200mg for pain and inflammation, which provided some relief but was not sufficient to control the disease progression. Subsequently, Methotrexate was introduced to help slow down joint damage and reduce inflammation. This medication significantly improved my symptoms, enabling me to carry out my professional duties and be present with my family.

Over time, as Rheumatoid Arthritis is a progressive condition, my treatment plan was adjusted. My healthcare team incorporated Hydroxychloroquine sulfate to complement the Methotrexate's effects, leading to better control of inflammation and pain. This combination proved to be highly effective in managing my symptoms and maintaining my quality of life.

Throughout my journey, I consulted with rheumatologists, general practitioners, and pharmacists who played crucial roles in tailoring my medication regimen to suit my specific needs. Their expertise and guidance have been instrumental in helping me navigate life with Rheumatoid Arthritis while balancing work and family responsibilities.
