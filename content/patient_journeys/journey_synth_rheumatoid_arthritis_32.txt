On 03/02/2022, I, a 35-year-old accountant from Norway, began experiencing the initial symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis - excruciating joint pain and stiffness, primarily in my hands and feet. The pain progressively worsened over the following weeks, impacting my ability to work and enjoy time with my family.

Seeking answers, I consulted my primary care physician on 03/21/2022. After multiple blood tests and imaging scans, I received the official diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis on 04/10/2022. However, there were no misdiagnoses or delays in this process.

To manage my symptoms, the healthcare professional prescribed a combination of medications. Initially, I was prescribed Naproxen 500mg twice daily to reduce inflammation and alleviate pain. While it provided some relief, the effectiveness waned over time, necessitating a change in treatment.

Upon consultation with a rheumatologist on 05/02/2022, Methotrexate was added to my regimen at a starting dose of 10mg weekly. This medication proved to be a game-changer, significantly reducing joint swelling and pain. Additionally, I was prescribed Hydroxychloroquine sulfate to further manage inflammation.

As months passed, my healthcare team adjusted the Methotrexate dosage to optimize its effectiveness. The combination of Methotrexate and Hydroxychloroquine sulfate has been instrumental in controlling my Rheumatoid Arthritis symptoms, allowing me to lead a more fulfilling life despite the challenges posed by the condition.

Throughout this journey, the collaborative efforts of my primary care physician and rheumatologist have been crucial in tailoring a medication regimen that best suits my needs. Their expertise and support have been invaluable in managing my condition and improving my quality of life.
