On January 23, 2021, I, a 35-year-old graphic designer from Russia, started experiencing joint pain, stiffness, and swelling in my hands and feet. Initially, I attributed it to overwork and stress, but as the symptoms persisted and worsened, I knew something more serious was at play.

After consulting with my family doctor in February 2021, I was referred to a rheumatologist. Despite presenting classic symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis, the diagnosis process was prolonged due to the complexity of the condition. I was initially misdiagnosed with osteoarthritis in April 2021, leading to ineffective treatment and continued suffering.

Finally, in June 2021, I received a confirmed diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis. The rheumatologist prescribed a combination of Methotrexate, Prednisone, and Hydroxychloroquine to manage the disease. Methotrexate was effective in reducing joint inflammation but caused nausea and fatigue initially. Prednisone provided rapid relief of symptoms but came with long-term side effects. Hydroxychloroquine helped to maintain stability in the disease progression.

Over the following months, I consulted with my rheumatologist regularly to monitor my response to the medications and adjust the dosages accordingly. In December 2021, due to persistent symptoms, my treatment plan was modified to include Tofacitinib alongside Methotrexate, leading to a significant improvement in joint pain and swelling.

Through the guidance of my healthcare team, consisting of rheumatologists, nurses, and physical therapists, I have been able to navigate the challenges of Rheumatoid Arthritis, finding a balance between managing my symptoms and maintaining my passion for graphic design and family life.
