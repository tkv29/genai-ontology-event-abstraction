I first experienced symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis on April 12, 2022, when I noticed persistent joint pain and swelling in my hands and knees. As a busy 37-year-old software engineer, these symptoms quickly began to impact my work and family life. Despite initially attributing the discomfort to stress and overwork, the symptoms worsened over the following weeks, leading me to seek medical help.

After a month of persistent symptoms, I consulted with my primary care physician, who referred me to a rheumatologist for further evaluation. The diagnosis process was challenging, with some initial misdiagnoses like regular joint strain or overuse injuries due to my work. It wasn't until mid-June that I received a confirmed diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Following the diagnosis, my rheumatologist prescribed a combination of medications to manage my symptoms and slow down the progression of the disease. Initially, I was started on Ibuprofen 200mg for pain relief, which provided some relief but was not sufficient long-term. By July, I was prescribed Meloxicam 15mg, which proved more effective in managing the joint pain and swelling.

As the disease progressed, my rheumatologist introduced Methotrexate in August to slow down the joint damage and reduce inflammation. While the side effects were challenging initially, the medication significantly improved my symptoms over time. By October, due to persistent symptoms, my treatment plan was adjusted to include Hydroxychloroquine sulfate alongside Methotrexate for better disease control.

Throughout my journey with Rheumatoid Arthritis, I have consulted closely with my rheumatologist, who closely monitored my progress and made adjustments to my medication regimen as needed. The continuous support and guidance from my healthcare team have been instrumental in managing my condition and improving my quality of life despite the challenges it presents.
