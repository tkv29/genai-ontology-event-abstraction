I first noticed symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis on February 5, 2023. It began with joint pain and stiffness, particularly in my hands and knees, making it challenging to perform everyday tasks. As a single mother working as a nurse, the symptoms quickly started affecting my ability to juggle both work and caring for my children.

After experiencing persistent symptoms for a month, I decided to consult a rheumatologist in early March. The diagnosis process was not straightforward, with initial confusion over the cause of my symptoms, leading to a delay in receiving the correct diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis in mid-April. Before the accurate diagnosis, I was misdiagnosed with generalized fatigue due to my demanding work schedule.

Upon confirmation of Rheumatoid Arthritis, my rheumatologist prescribed a combination of medications to manage the symptoms and slow disease progression. Initially, I was prescribed Naproxen to alleviate joint pain and inflammation. While Naproxen provided some relief, it wasn't sufficient to control the progressing symptoms.

In May, my treatment plan was adjusted, and I was prescribed Methotrexate alongside Naproxen. Methotrexate significantly improved my symptoms, reducing joint pain and inflammation, allowing me to continue working and caring for my children effectively. Despite some initial side effects like nausea and fatigue, the benefits outweighed the drawbacks.

As my condition stabilized, my rheumatologist introduced Hydroxychloroquine in July to further manage the disease and prevent flare-ups. The combination of Methotrexate, Naproxen, and Hydroxychloroquine has been successful in controlling my Rheumatoid Arthritis symptoms, enabling me to lead a fulfilling life despite the challenges posed by the disease.

Throughout my journey, I consulted with rheumatologists and discussed treatment plans, ensuring that my medications were tailored to my specific needs and effectively managed my symptoms. The continuous support from healthcare professionals alongside the prescribed medications has been crucial in enhancing my quality of life and enabling me to navigate the complexities of living with Rheumatoid Arthritis.
