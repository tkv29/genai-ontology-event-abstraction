On the 26th of July 2023, I first noticed the initial symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis - persistent joint pain, swelling, and stiffness. As an architect juggling long hours, the symptoms began affecting my work and personal life. My dedication to providing for my family made it challenging to slow down and address my health concerns.

Seeking help, I consulted with a rheumatologist in August 2023 to investigate the symptoms. However, the diagnosis process was not straightforward. Initially, the symptoms were mistaken for general joint strain or overwork-related issues, leading to delays in identifying the underlying cause. It was not until September 2023 that a conclusive diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis was made, after several tests and consultations.

Upon diagnosis, a treatment plan was established, including a variety of medications to manage the Rheumatoid Arthritis symptoms. I was prescribed Methotrexate initially, which helped to alleviate some inflammation but caused unpleasant side effects. In October 2023, my rheumatologist adjusted the treatment plan and introduced Hydroxychloroquine sulfate alongside Methotrexate. This combination proved more effective in managing the pain and swelling, allowing me to continue working with reduced discomfort.

As the year progressed, the treatment was further refined. In January 2024, Prednisone was added to the medication regimen during flares to provide immediate relief from severe joint pain. While this helped during acute episodes, the long-term side effects were concerning. Throughout the journey, regular check-ups with my rheumatologist were crucial in monitoring the effectiveness of the medications and adjusting the treatment plan accordingly.

The support and understanding of my family, especially my wife, were invaluable during this challenging time. The medications provided relief from the debilitating symptoms, allowing me to balance work and family life better. Despite the sacrifices and uncertainties, managing Rheumatoid Arthritis with the appropriate medications has been essential for maintaining my quality of life and continuing to pursue my passion for architecture.
