On August 28, 2020, I first noticed symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis - persistent joint pain and swelling in my hands and feet. As a 35-year-old single mother and nurse, the pain made it challenging to care for my kids and work efficiently. 

After months of worsening symptoms, I sought medical help. I consulted with my primary care physician in October 2020, who initially prescribed Ibuprofen to manage the pain. However, as my symptoms persisted, I was referred to a rheumatologist in December 2020 for further evaluation.

The rheumatologist diagnosed me with Rheumatoid Arthritis in January 2021 after conducting thorough tests. Initially, I was prescribed Methotrexate to slow down the progression of the disease. While it helped manage the inflammation, I experienced severe nausea as a side effect.

In April 2021, my rheumatologist added Hydroxychloroquine to my treatment regimen, which improved my symptoms significantly. By June 2021, the combination of Methotrexate and Hydroxychloroquine provided me with better pain management and increased mobility.

In August 2021, due to persistent joint pain, my Rheumatologist introduced Prednisone as a short-term solution to reduce inflammation during a flare-up. Although effective, Prednisone came with side effects like weight gain and mood swings, requiring close monitoring.

I continued regular consultations with my rheumatologist to monitor my progress and adjust medications as needed. Despite the challenges, the prescribed medications have played a crucial role in managing my Rheumatoid Arthritis symptoms and allowing me to juggle work and motherhood more effectively.

Overall, the journey with Rheumatoid Arthritis has been challenging, but with the right medications and ongoing medical support, I have found relief and improved quality of life. Through this process, I have developed a deeper appreciation for the importance of proper treatment in managing chronic conditions like Rheumatoid Arthritis.
