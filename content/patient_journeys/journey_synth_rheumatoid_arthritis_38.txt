I first noticed the onset of Rheumatoid Arthritis symptoms on April 7, 2021. The initial signs were joint pain, swelling, and stiffness, primarily affecting my hands and knees. As a software engineer, these symptoms greatly impacted my work and family life. 

The process of getting diagnosed was challenging. Initially, I visited a general practitioner who suspected it might be a result of overworking and stress. However, as the symptoms persisted and worsened, I sought a second opinion from a rheumatologist. After a series of blood tests and imaging studies, I was officially diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis in May 2021.

Following the diagnosis, I was prescribed a combination of medications to manage my symptoms. Initially, I started with Naproxen 500mg twice daily for pain relief and inflammation control. While it helped to some extent, the relief was short-lived, prompting my rheumatologist to introduce Methotrexate 15mg weekly to slow down disease progression. The Methotrexate proved effective in managing inflammation and joint damage, allowing me to function better at work and home.

As the disease continued to flare up occasionally, my medication regimen was adjusted to include Hydroxychloroquine 200mg daily for additional symptom control. This combination significantly improved my quality of life, enabling me to tackle my demanding job and spend quality time with my family.

Throughout my journey with Rheumatoid Arthritis, I consulted a dedicated rheumatologist who guided me through various treatment options and adjustments based on my response to medications. Their expertise and support were instrumental in helping me find the right balance of medications to effectively manage my condition.

Overall, the medications prescribed, including Naproxen, Methotrexate, and Hydroxychloroquine, have been crucial in alleviating my symptoms, reducing inflammation, and enhancing my daily function, allowing me to pursue my career goals and cherish moments with my loved ones.
