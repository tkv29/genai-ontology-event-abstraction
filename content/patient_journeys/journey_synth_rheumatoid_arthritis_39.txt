The journey with Rheumatoid Arthritis began for me on 12/11/2021, when I started experiencing persistent joint pain, swelling, and stiffness, particularly in my hands and feet. As a busy 35-year-old graphic designer and single parent, these symptoms significantly hindered my ability to work efficiently and manage daily tasks.

Seeking answers, I consulted a rheumatologist on 01/12/2021, who diagnosed me with Rheumatoid Arthritis after thorough physical exams and blood tests. Prior to this, some misdiagnoses and delays occurred as my symptoms were initially attributed to overwork and stress.

The prescribed medications aimed at managing my Rheumatoid Arthritis symptoms included:

1. Methotrexate: Initiated at a low dose, methotrexate helped in reducing joint inflammation and pain effectively. Its effectiveness became noticeable around 3 weeks after starting the medication.

2. Prednisone: Initially prescribed for its fast-acting anti-inflammatory properties, prednisone provided quick relief from severe flare-ups, but its long-term use was limited due to side effects.

3. Hydroxychloroquine: Added to my treatment plan to control disease activity, hydroxychloroquine showed gradual improvement in joint pain and stiffness over a few weeks.

4. Ibuprofen: Prescribed as needed for additional pain relief during flare-ups, ibuprofen provided temporary comfort but was not a long-term solution due to concerns about its impact on the stomach.

Regular follow-ups with my rheumatologist and a collaborative approach to adjusting the medication dosages based on my symptoms and blood test results were crucial in managing my Rheumatoid Arthritis effectively. Despite the challenges of balancing work and parenting, the prescribed medications played a vital role in improving my quality of life and maintaining my ability to fulfill both personal and professional responsibilities.
