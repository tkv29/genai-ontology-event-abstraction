On March 25, 2022, I, a 35-year-old graphic designer from France, started experiencing joint pain, stiffness, and swelling, particularly in my hands and feet. As the symptoms persisted, impacting my ability to work and care for my family, I sought medical advice in early April 2022. Initially, my symptoms were brushed off as overexertion or potentially due to stress.

After persistent symptoms, I consulted a rheumatologist in late April. Following a series of blood tests, imaging scans, and a physical examination, I was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis in early May 2022. The delayed diagnosis was frustrating, but finally having an answer brought some relief.

For managing my Rheumatoid Arthritis, my healthcare provider prescribed a combination of medications to alleviate pain, reduce inflammation, and slow down disease progression. Initially, I was prescribed Naproxen to manage pain and inflammation. However, as the condition progressed, the doctor introduced Methotrexate to help slow down joint damage.

Despite the initial effectiveness of Naproxen in reducing pain and swelling, the addition of Methotrexate significantly improved my symptoms and overall quality of life. While adjusting to the side effects of Methotrexate was challenging, the long-term benefits outweighed the temporary discomfort.

Throughout my journey with Rheumatoid Arthritis, I have consulted with a rheumatologist regularly to monitor my progress, adjust medications, and address any concerns. Their expertise and guidance have been invaluable in managing this chronic condition effectively.

In conclusion, the journey with Rheumatoid Arthritis has been a rollercoaster of emotions and challenges. However, the right combination of medications, including Naproxen and Methotrexate, has played a crucial role in managing my symptoms and allowing me to continue pursuing my passion for graphic design while being present for my family.
