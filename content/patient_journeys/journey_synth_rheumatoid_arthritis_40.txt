On October 24, 2022, I, a 38-year-old single mother and nurse from Kosovo, began experiencing the initial symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis. It started with persistent joint pain and swelling in my hands and feet, impacting my ability to work and care for my two young children effectively.

Seeking answers, I consulted my primary care physician on November 5, 2022, who suspected Rheumatoid Arthritis. However, due to the complexity of the diagnosis process, there were some delays. It wasn't until December 10, 2022, after consulting with a rheumatologist, that I received an official diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis, following initial misdiagnoses of general joint pain.

To manage my condition, I was prescribed a combination of medications to alleviate symptoms and slow disease progression. Initially, I was started on Ibuprofen 200mg to relieve pain and inflammation. While it provided some relief initially, the effectiveness decreased over time.

As my symptoms persisted, my rheumatologist introduced Naproxen 250mg daily on January 15, 2023, which proved more effective in managing my pain and improving joint functionality. However, I struggled with minor side effects like indigestion and had to adjust my dosage accordingly.

Aside from medications aimed at symptom relief, on February 20, 2023, Methotrexate was added to my treatment plan to modify the course of the disease. This immunosuppressant helped reduce inflammation and slow down joint damage, significantly improving my overall quality of life.

Throughout my journey with Rheumatoid Arthritis, I have consulted with rheumatologists, primary care physicians, and pharmacists for regular monitoring and adjustments to my treatment plan. Their expertise and support have been crucial in finding the right combination of medications to manage my symptoms effectively and ensure I can continue caring for my family and working as a nurse.
