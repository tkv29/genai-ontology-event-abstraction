I first noticed the symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis on September 24, 2022. It began with joint pain and stiffness, particularly in my wrists and knees. As a busy marketing executive and mom, the discomfort initially seemed like a result of my hectic lifestyle. However, the symptoms persisted and worsened over the following weeks, affecting my ability to carry out daily tasks and care for my children.

Concerned about the escalating pain, I sought medical advice. After a series of tests and consultations with rheumatologists, I received my official diagnosis on November 10, 2022. The process of diagnosis was challenging, with initial misdiagnoses of general joint strain causing delay in receiving appropriate treatment for Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Upon diagnosis, my healthcare team prescribed a combination of medications to manage my symptoms effectively:

1. Methotrexate: Initiated at 10mg weekly, gradually increased to 20mg - This medication significantly reduced joint pain and inflammation, allowing me to carry out daily activities with greater ease.

2. Prednisone: 5mg daily - Provided rapid relief during flare-ups, easing the intensity of symptoms and improving my overall mobility.

3. Naproxen: 500mg twice daily - Helped in reducing swelling and tenderness in the affected joints.

4. Hydroxychloroquine: 200mg daily - Played a crucial role in controlling disease progression and maintaining joint function.

5. Physical therapy sessions were also incorporated into my treatment plan to improve mobility and strengthen the affected joints.

Throughout this journey, I consulted with rheumatologists, physical therapists, and a nutritionist to ensure a holistic approach to managing Rheumatoid Arthritis. The medications prescribed, especially Methotrexate and Prednisone, played vital roles in alleviating my symptoms and improving my quality of life. While there were initial challenges in diagnosis, finding the right medication regimen has been instrumental in helping me balance my work and family responsibilities despite living with Rheumatoid Arthritis.
