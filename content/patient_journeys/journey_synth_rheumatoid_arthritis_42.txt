I first experienced symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis on September 22, 2022, when I noticed persistent joint pain and swelling in my hands and feet, accompanied by morning stiffness that lasted for hours. As a busy single mother working as a nurse, these symptoms significantly impacted my ability to work and care for my children.

Seeking answers, I consulted my primary care physician, who referred me to a rheumatologist. Despite suspecting Rheumatoid Arthritis, the diagnosis process involved several tests and appointments, leading to a definitive diagnosis on October 15, 2022. However, there were initial concerns about other possible conditions, causing slight delays in starting appropriate treatment.

Upon diagnosis, my rheumatologist prescribed a combination of medications to manage my symptoms effectively. Initially, I was prescribed Naproxen 250mg twice daily to alleviate pain and inflammation. While it provided some relief, the symptoms persisted, prompting a switch to Methotrexate starting on November 2, 2022. Methotrexate proved more effective in controlling the progression of the disease and reducing joint inflammation.

As my symptoms fluctuated, my rheumatologist added Hydroxychloroquine sulfate to my regimen on November 20, 2022, to further manage inflammation and prevent joint damage. This combination significantly improved my quality of life, allowing me to work and care for my children more comfortably.

Throughout my journey, I consulted with my primary care physician for regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor the medications' effectiveness and any potential side effects. The collaborative effort between my healthcare providers ensured a tailored treatment plan that addressed my specific needs, leading to better symptom management and an improved overall well-being.
