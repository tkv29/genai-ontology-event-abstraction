I first noticed symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis on 17/07/2023, experiencing joint pain and stiffness, particularly in my hands and knees. As a busy single mother working as a nurse, these symptoms gradually worsened, affecting my ability to care for my children and work effectively.

Seeking medical advice, I consulted my primary care physician on 25/07/2023, who initially prescribed Ibuprofen to alleviate the pain. However, as the symptoms persisted and intensified over the following weeks, I was referred to a rheumatologist on 10/08/2023 for further evaluation.

After a series of tests, including blood work and imaging studies, I was formally diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis on 28/08/2023. Unfortunately, there was a delay in diagnosis due to the initially mild nature of my symptoms.

Following the diagnosis, my rheumatologist prescribed a combination of Methotrexate and Hydroxychloroquine to manage the inflammatory process and slow the progression of the disease. While these medications provided some relief, I continued to experience moderate joint pain and fatigue.

As my symptoms persisted, my treatment plan was adjusted on 15/09/2023, with the addition of Prednisone to help control the inflammation and alleviate pain during flare-ups. This combination proved more effective in managing my symptoms, allowing me to function better at work and home.

Throughout my journey with Rheumatoid Arthritis, I have consulted with my rheumatologist regularly for monitoring and adjustments to my medication regimen. The healthcare professionals I worked closely with, including my primary care physician and rheumatologist, played a crucial role in guiding me through the challenges of living with this chronic condition.

Overall, the combination of Methotrexate, Hydroxychloroquine, and Prednisone has helped me better manage my Rheumatoid Arthritis symptoms, improving my quality of life and enabling me to continue fulfilling my duties as a nurse and a mother.
