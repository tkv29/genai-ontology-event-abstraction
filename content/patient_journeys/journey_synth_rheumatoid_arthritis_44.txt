I first started experiencing symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis on July 10, 2021. It began with persistent joint pain and swelling in my hands and wrists, accompanied by morning stiffness that lasted for hours. As a busy software engineer, these symptoms significantly impacted my ability to work efficiently and enjoy family moments with my pregnant wife.

The journey to diagnosis was challenging, with several misdiagnoses and delays. Initially, my symptoms were mistaken for regular joint strain by a general practitioner, which led to a delay in seeking specialized care. It was only after consulting a rheumatologist in mid-August that I received a confirmed diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Upon diagnosis, my healthcare provider prescribed a combination of medications to manage my symptoms effectively. Initially, I was started on Ibuprofen to alleviate pain and reduce inflammation, but the relief was minimal. Subsequently, I was prescribed Methotrexate to target the underlying cause of my condition. This medication proved to be significantly more effective in controlling the progression of Rheumatoid Arthritis and improving my quality of life.

Over the following months, my treatment plan was adjusted to include Hydroxychloroquine sulfate and Prednisone to further manage inflammation and pain. While these medications provided relief, the combination of Methotrexate and Hydroxychloroquine sulfate has been most effective in reducing joint pain, swelling, and stiffness, allowing me to function better both at work and at home.

Throughout my journey, I have consulted with rheumatologists, primary care physicians, and pharmacists to ensure proper management of my condition. Their expertise and guidance have been invaluable in finding the right combination of medications to address my Rheumatoid Arthritis symptoms and support my journey towards a healthier and more active lifestyle.
