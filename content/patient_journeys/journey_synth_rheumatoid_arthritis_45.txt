On February 1, 2022, I, a 35-year-old accountant from Kosovo, began experiencing stiffness and pain in my joints, particularly in my hands and knees. The symptoms gradually worsened over the following weeks, making it challenging to perform daily tasks. Concerned, I went to see my family doctor on February 15, who suspected Rheumatoid Arthritis due to the symmetrical joint involvement and referred me to a rheumatologist.

After a series of blood tests, imaging studies, and a physical examination, I was officially diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis on March 5, 2022. However, prior to this diagnosis, I was initially misdiagnosed with bursitis, leading to a delay in receiving appropriate treatment.

Following my diagnosis, I was prescribed a combination of medications to manage my symptoms effectively. Initially, I was started on Naproxen 500mg twice daily for pain and inflammation. While it provided some relief, the side effects were bothersome, leading my rheumatologist to switch me to Methotrexate on April 1. Methotrexate, taken once weekly, significantly improved my joint pain and swelling. Additionally, I was prescribed Prednisone in the initial phase to control inflammation, which was gradually tapered off.

As my condition progressed, my rheumatologist introduced Hydroxychloroquine sulfate on April 30 to further manage my symptoms and prevent long-term joint damage. This combination proved highly effective in controlling my Rheumatoid Arthritis symptoms, allowing me to better cope with my work and family responsibilities.

Throughout my journey with Rheumatoid Arthritis, I have consulted a rheumatologist and my family doctor regularly for monitoring and adjustments to my medication regimen. Their expertise and support have been crucial in managing my condition and improving my quality of life.

Overall, the medications prescribed, including Methotrexate, Prednisone, Naproxen, and Hydroxychloroquine sulfate, have played a vital role in alleviating my symptoms and enhancing my daily functioning, enabling me to lead a fulfilling life despite the challenges posed by Rheumatoid Arthritis.
