I first noticed the initial symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis in January 2023, experiencing persistent joint pain, stiffness, and swelling in my hands and feet. As a nurse, I initially attributed the discomfort to long hours on my feet at the hospital, but the symptoms worsened over the following weeks.

Concerned about the escalating pain, I consulted my primary care physician in February. After conducting blood tests and a physical examination, I was referred to a rheumatologist. However, the process of getting an official diagnosis was prolonged due to the complexity of RA symptoms that can mimic other conditions.

In April, I was finally diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis by a rheumatologist after ruling out other possible conditions through imaging tests and more specific blood work.

The medication journey began with the prescription of Naproxen for pain and inflammation. While it provided some relief, the rheumatologist later introduced Methotrexate to slow disease progression. This combination proved effective in managing my symptoms, improving joint function and reducing inflammation significantly.

Over time, adjustments were made in my medication regimen, including the addition of Hydroxychloroquine sulfate to further control the autoimmune response. These medications, along with lifestyle changes and regular consultations with my rheumatologist, have helped me maintain a balance between work, family, and managing Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Through the support and guidance of my healthcare team, I have been able to navigate the challenges of living with RA while continuing to pursue my passion for nursing and being present for my loved ones.
