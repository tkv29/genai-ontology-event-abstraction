I first noticed the initial symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis in early February 2022. Persistent joint pain, swelling, and stiffness made simple tasks challenging. As a 35-year-old lawyer and single mother of two, the symptoms severely impacted both my professional and personal life. 

Seeking answers, I consulted a rheumatologist in late February after initial blood tests and imaging hinted at an autoimmune condition. The diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis was confirmed in early March after more specific blood tests and a thorough physical examination. There were no misdiagnoses, but the process felt prolonged due to the complexity of autoimmune conditions.

Initially, my rheumatologist prescribed Naproxen 500mg twice daily to manage the inflammation and pain. While it provided some relief, the symptoms persisted, leading to the inclusion of Methotrexate 15mg weekly in mid-March. This combination helped in reducing the joint swelling significantly. However, as the disease progressed, my dose of Methotrexate was increased to 20mg weekly in April to maintain its effectiveness.

In June, due to persistent symptoms and concerns about long-term Methotrexate use, my rheumatologist introduced Hydroxychloroquine 200mg daily alongside my existing regimen. This addition brought further improvement, especially in mitigating morning stiffness, allowing me to start my days more comfortably.

Throughout this journey, I have consulted closely with my rheumatologist, who has been instrumental in adjusting my medications to manage the evolving nature of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Despite the challenges of balancing a demanding career and motherhood, the medications have played a crucial role in enhancing my quality of life and allowing me to continue fulfilling my responsibilities.
