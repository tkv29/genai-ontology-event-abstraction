I initially started experiencing symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis on May 24, 2020. It began with joint stiffness in my fingers, followed by swelling and intense pain that made it challenging to perform daily tasks at work and take care of my children.

The process of getting diagnosed was not straightforward. Despite my persistent symptoms, my initial physician attributed them to overexertion from work. It was only after seeking a second opinion from a rheumatologist in July 2020 that I was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis. The delay in diagnosis was frustrating and led to unnecessary pain and discomfort.

Following the diagnosis, I was prescribed a combination of medications to manage my symptoms. Initially, I started with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like Ibuprofen to alleviate pain and reduce inflammation. While Ibuprofen provided some relief, the effects were not long-lasting, and I often experienced flare-ups.

As my condition progressed, I was prescribed Methotrexate in September 2020 to help slow down the progression of joint damage. Methotrexate was more effective in managing my symptoms compared to NSAIDs, but I experienced side effects such as nausea and fatigue.

In December 2020, due to persistent symptoms and the limited effectiveness of Methotrexate, my rheumatologist added Hydroxychloroquine to my treatment regimen. This combination proved to be more beneficial in controlling inflammation and improving my overall quality of life.

Throughout my journey with Rheumatoid Arthritis, I consulted with rheumatologists, general physicians, and pharmacists to monitor my condition and adjust my medication accordingly. The support and expertise of these healthcare professionals played a crucial role in managing my symptoms and providing me with relief from the challenges posed by this chronic condition.
