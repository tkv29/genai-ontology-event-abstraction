On January 16, 2023, I, a 35-year-old nurse and single mother of three from France, started experiencing the first symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis. It began with persistent joint pain and swelling in my fingers, making it challenging to perform everyday tasks at work and home.

Despite the demanding nature of my job and taking care of my children, the symptoms worsened over the following weeks. By early February, the pain had spread to my knees and elbows, impacting my ability to work efficiently and engage in physical activities with my children.

Seeking answers, I consulted my primary care physician, who suspected Rheumatoid Arthritis and referred me to a rheumatologist. The diagnosis process was challenging, with initial misdiagnoses of other musculoskeletal conditions causing delays in receiving appropriate treatment.

After several tests and consultations with specialists, I was finally diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis in March 2023. My treatment plan included a combination of medications to manage the symptoms effectively.

I was prescribed Methotrexate initially to control the inflammatory response, and despite some initial side effects like nausea, it proved to be highly effective in reducing joint pain and swelling. Additionally, my rheumatologist introduced Hydroxychloroquine sulfate to further manage the symptoms, which provided significant relief and improved my overall quality of life.

As my condition progressed, I also started a course of Prednisone during flare-ups to manage acute pain and inflammation swiftly. The combination of these medications has allowed me to continue working as a nurse and caring for my children with more comfort and mobility.

Throughout my journey with Rheumatoid Arthritis, I have consulted a team of healthcare professionals, including rheumatologists, physiotherapists, and occupational therapists, who have played a crucial role in managing my condition and providing ongoing support.

Despite the challenges, the medications prescribed have been instrumental in controlling my symptoms and allowing me to lead a fulfilling life, balancing my responsibilities at work and home while effectively managing Rheumatoid Arthritis.
