On 09/10/2020, I, a 30-year-old lawyer from Austria, began experiencing joint pain, swelling, and stiffness, particularly in my hands and feet. Ignoring the discomfort at first, it escalated over the following weeks, affecting my daily activities and work productivity. Concerned about worsening symptoms, I visited my primary care physician on 10/15/2020, who suspected Rheumatoid Arthritis and referred me to a rheumatologist.

Due to the demanding nature of my job and family responsibilities, I faced challenges in balancing my health needs with my daily routine. After further examinations and tests, I was officially diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis on 11/05/2020, after ruling out other conditions. The diagnosis brought relief by finally giving a name to the persistent pain I was experiencing.

Following the diagnosis, my rheumatologist prescribed a combination therapy to manage my symptoms. Initially, I was prescribed Naproxen and Hydroxychloroquine sulfate to alleviate pain and reduce inflammation. While Naproxen provided immediate relief, Hydroxychloroquine sulfate took longer to show its full effect but contributed to long-term management of the condition.

As my symptoms persisted, Methotrexate was added to my treatment regimen on 12/01/2020. This medication significantly improved my joint pain and stiffness, allowing me to be more active both at work and with my family. Regular consultations with my rheumatologist helped in monitoring the effectiveness of the medications and adjusting the doses when necessary.

Despite the occasional side effects, such as nausea and fatigue, the medications have played a crucial role in managing my Rheumatoid Arthritis symptoms. The support and guidance from my healthcare team have been instrumental in my journey to finding a balance between my career, family, and health.
