I first noticed symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis on 01/04/2020 â€“ joint pain, stiffness, and swelling in my hands and feet. As a nurse and single mother, the pain made my long shifts at the hospital and caring for my daughter challenging.

The road to diagnosis was not easy. I consulted my primary care physician regularly, but my symptoms were initially attributed to overwork and stress. It wasn't until 06/05/2020, after persistent symptoms and further tests, that I was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis by a rheumatologist.

My prescribed medications have evolved as we found what works best for me:
- Initially starting with Ibuprofen 100mg, I found some relief but needed stronger medication.
- Moving on to Methotrexate on 06/21/2020, I experienced significant improvement in joint pain and swelling.
- Combining Methotrexate with Hydroxychloroquine on 07/15/2020 further enhanced my quality of life.
- Flare-ups were managed with short-term courses of Prednisone, starting on 09/10/2020.

Consulting with my rheumatologist regularly, we adjusted dosages and medications to find the right balance. Methotrexate and Hydroxychloroquine combination worked best for me in managing my symptoms, allowing me to continue working and caring for my daughter effectively.

Throughout my journey with Rheumatoid Arthritis, the support and expertise of my healthcare team, including my primary care physician and rheumatologist, have been invaluable in finding the right medications to improve my quality of life.
