I first noticed symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis on 30/09/2021, experiencing joint pain, stiffness, and swelling in my hands and feet. As a graphic designer, these symptoms significantly impacted my work and family life. 

Seeking help, I consulted with my primary care physician, who referred me to a rheumatologist. The diagnosis process was challenging, with initial misdiagnoses of general fatigue delaying the identification of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Finally, on 15/11/2021, I received the confirmed diagnosis.

The healthcare professionals I consulted included my primary care physician, rheumatologist, and later a pain management specialist. The treatment journey began with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like Ibuprofen, which provided some relief but didn't fully manage the symptoms.

Progressing in my treatment, I was prescribed Methotrexate on 25/12/2021, which proved more effective in controlling inflammation and joint pain. However, I experienced side effects like nausea and hair loss. Adjustments were made, and on 10/02/2022, my healthcare provider added Hydroxychloroquine to my regimen, aiming to enhance the overall efficacy of the treatment.

By 01/03/2022, with the combination of Methotrexate and Hydroxychloroquine, I observed a significant improvement in my symptoms, allowing me to better manage my work and spend quality time with my family. The journey continues, with regular check-ins to monitor progress and adjust medications as needed.
