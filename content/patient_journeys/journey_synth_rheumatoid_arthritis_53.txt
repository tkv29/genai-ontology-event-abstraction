On April 14, 2021, I, a 35-year-old accountant from Armenia, experienced the first symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis â€“ excruciating joint pain and swelling that made even simple tasks at work and home challenging. As the symptoms persisted, I decided to seek medical advice.

After weeks of persistent pain, I consulted with a rheumatologist on May 5, 2021, who suspected Rheumatoid Arthritis. However, due to the complexity of RA diagnosis, it wasn't confirmed until June 2, 2021, following numerous tests ruling out other conditions. The process was frustrating with a sense of relief upon receiving a definitive diagnosis.

The prescribed medications aimed to manage my symptoms and improve my quality of life. Initially, I was prescribed Naproxen 500mg daily, which provided moderate relief but caused digestive issues. Subsequently, I was switched to Meloxicam 15mg on July 1, 2021, offering better pain control with fewer side effects. However, occasional breakthrough pain required short-term use of Ibuprofen 400mg as needed.

As my condition progressed, my rheumatologist introduced Methotrexate on August 10, 2021, to slow disease progression and reduce inflammation. This addition significantly improved my joint stiffness and swelling over time, enhancing my ability to balance work and family responsibilities. Furthermore, regular blood tests were crucial to monitor Methotrexate's impact on my liver function and overall health.

Throughout this journey, the support and guidance of my rheumatologist were invaluable. Their expertise in adjusting medications and monitoring my progress played a fundamental role in managing my Rheumatoid Arthritis effectively. Despite the initial challenges, the combination of Meloxicam and Methotrexate has substantially improved my symptoms, allowing me to continue providing for my family while cherishing precious moments with my loved ones.
