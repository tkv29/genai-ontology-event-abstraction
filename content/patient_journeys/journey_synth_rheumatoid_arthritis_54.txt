On July 23, 2021, I started experiencing excruciating joint pain, particularly in my hands, wrists, and knees. As a nurse and a single mother, the physical demands of my job and caring for my children became increasingly challenging. Despite brushing off the initial discomfort as work-related strain, the symptoms persisted and worsened over the following weeks.

Eventually, on August 15, 2021, I sought medical help due to persistent joint pain, morning stiffness, and fatigue. After a series of blood tests, imaging studies, and consultations with rheumatologists, I was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis on September 5, 2021. The road to diagnosis was challenging, with initial misdiagnoses of overexertion and general stress delaying the appropriate treatment.

Upon confirmation of Rheumatoid Arthritis, my healthcare team prescribed a combination of medications to manage my symptoms. I was initially started on Ibuprofen 400mg twice daily for pain and inflammation. While Ibuprofen provided some relief, the symptoms persisted, prompting the addition of Methotrexate on September 20, 2021.

The introduction of Methotrexate significantly improved my symptoms, reducing joint pain, swelling, and stiffness. However, as the disease progressed, my rheumatologist adjusted my treatment plan, incorporating Prednisone on October 10, 2021, to manage flare-ups effectively.

The collaborative effort with my healthcare team, which included rheumatologists, primary care physicians, and pain management specialists, played a crucial role in tailoring my medication regimen to my evolving needs. Through regular monitoring and adjustments, we found a balance that effectively manages my Rheumatoid Arthritis symptoms, allowing me to continue working and caring for my family with greater ease and comfort.
