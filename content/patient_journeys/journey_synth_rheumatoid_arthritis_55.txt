On 15th February 2022, as a 36-year-old nurse from Bosnia and Herzegovina, I began experiencing the first symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Initially, I noticed stiffness and swelling in my joints, especially in the mornings, impacting my ability to care for my patients and children. 

Seeking help, I consulted with my primary care physician, who referred me to a rheumatologist after suspecting Rheumatoid Arthritis. However, the process of diagnosis faced delays due to the complexity of the condition and similarities with other autoimmune disorders. Misdiagnosed initially with fibromyalgia, it took until 25th April 2022 for a confirmed diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis to be made through blood tests and imaging.

In managing my condition, I have been prescribed a combination of medications tailored to alleviate symptoms and slow disease progression. Initially, I started with Ibuprofen 200mg for pain and inflammation, which provided moderate relief but was not sufficient long-term. Subsequently, my rheumatologist introduced Methotrexate 15mg weekly, which significantly improved joint swelling and stiffness. 

In addition to Methotrexate, I was prescribed Hydroxychloroquine 200mg daily to further control inflammation. This combination proved highly effective in managing my Rheumatoid Arthritis symptoms, allowing me to continue working and caring for my children with reduced discomfort and increased mobility. Regular check-ups with my rheumatologist ensured that the treatment plan was optimized and adjusted when needed.

Throughout my journey with Rheumatoid Arthritis, the expertise and guidance of my rheumatologist have been invaluable in finding the right medication combination for my individual needs. The medications prescribed have not only alleviated my symptoms but also enhanced my overall quality of life, empowering me to continue fulfilling my role as a nurse and a single mother with greater ease and comfort.
