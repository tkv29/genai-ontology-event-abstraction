On September 18, 2020, at the age of 35, I, a software engineer from Montenegro, began experiencing the initial symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Persistent joint pain in my hands, feet, and knees made simple tasks challenging. As the weeks passed, the pain intensified, accompanied by stiffness and swelling in affected joints.

Seeking relief, I consulted a rheumatologist in October 2020, who suspected Rheumatoid Arthritis and ordered a series of blood tests and imaging scans. However, due to the complexities of diagnosing autoimmune conditions, it took until November for a definitive diagnosis to be made, after ruling out other potential conditions like osteoarthritis.

Upon diagnosis, my rheumatologist prescribed a combination of medications to manage my symptoms. Initially, I was started on Naproxen to reduce inflammation and relieve pain. While it provided some relief, the effectiveness waned over time, leading to the addition of Methotrexate in December. This disease-modifying antirheumatic drug helped slow the progression of the condition and provided more consistent relief.

Over the following months, as the disease continued its course, my treatment plan evolved. In April 2021, Azathioprine was introduced to enhance the effects of Methotrexate. This combination significantly reduced inflammation and improved joint function, allowing me to better navigate both my demanding work schedule and family responsibilities.

Throughout my journey with Rheumatoid Arthritis, I have consulted with a team of healthcare professionals, including rheumatologists, physical therapists, and pain management specialists. Their expertise and collaborative approach have been instrumental in finding a medication regimen that suits my needs, effectively managing my symptoms, and maintaining a fulfilling work-life balance.
