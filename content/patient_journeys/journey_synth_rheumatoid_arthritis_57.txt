I first noticed symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis on 28/06/2020, experiencing joint pain and stiffness in my fingers, which progressively worsened over the following weeks. Concerned, I consulted my primary care physician on 10/07/2020, who initially suspected it might be due to overwork and advised rest.

As the symptoms persisted, I sought a second opinion from a rheumatologist on 05/08/2020. After thorough examinations and blood tests, including rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP antibody tests, I received a confirmed diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis on 25/08/2020. There were no misdiagnoses but a slight delay due to the complex nature of the disease.

The rheumatologist prescribed a combination of medications tailored to manage my symptoms effectively. Initially, I was prescribed Ibuprofen 400mg thrice daily for joint pain and inflammation, which provided partial relief. However, due to persistent symptoms, the medication was switched to Methotrexate 15mg weekly on 10/09/2020. Methotrexate significantly improved my symptoms and slowed disease progression.

As the disease progressed, I experienced a flare-up on 05/10/2020, characterized by severe joint swelling and pain. The rheumatologist added Prednisone 10mg daily as a short-term solution to alleviate the flare-up, which worked effectively in reducing inflammation and pain during the episode.

Throughout my journey with Rheumatoid Arthritis, I have consulted with a rheumatologist regularly for follow-ups and medication adjustments. The healthcare professionals played a vital role in monitoring my progress and ensuring the medications were optimized to manage my symptoms and improve my quality of life effectively.
