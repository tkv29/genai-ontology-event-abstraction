The initial symptoms of my Rheumatoid Arthritis journey began on 08/11/2022 - joint pain, stiffness, and swelling in my hands and feet. As a single mother and nurse, these symptoms significantly impacted my ability to work and care for my children.

The process of getting diagnosed was challenging. Initially, my symptoms were dismissed as overexertion due to my demanding job. It took multiple visits to different healthcare professionals, including my GP and a rheumatologist, before receiving a definitive diagnosis on 09/25/2022. There were no misdiagnoses, but the process felt prolonged due to the nature of Rheumatoid Arthritis symptoms being mistaken for general fatigue.

For managing my Rheumatoid Arthritis, I was prescribed a combination of medications. Initially, I started on Ibuprofen 400mg to help with pain and inflammation. While it provided some relief, the effects were short-lived. Upon consultation with my rheumatologist on 10/10/2022, I was started on Methotrexate 15mg weekly. This medication was a game-changer, significantly reducing joint pain and swelling.

As my condition progressed, my rheumatologist added Prednisone 10mg daily for a short period during a flare-up, which provided immediate relief. However, due to its long-term side effects, we opted for a more targeted approach with Leflunomide 20mg daily, which has been effective in managing my symptoms and improving my quality of life.

Throughout this journey, I consulted with my GP, rheumatologist, and a physiotherapist who played a crucial role in developing a holistic approach to managing my Rheumatoid Arthritis. The combination of medications tailored to my symptoms and lifestyle has been instrumental in allowing me to continue working and caring for my family despite the challenges posed by this condition.
