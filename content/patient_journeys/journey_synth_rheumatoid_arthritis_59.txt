On January 16, 2021, as a 35-year-old nurse and single mother in Russia, I began noticing symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Initially, I experienced persistent joint pain, swelling, and stiffness, particularly in my hands and knees. As the weeks passed, the symptoms worsened, affecting my ability to work and care for my children effectively.

Seeking a diagnosis, I consulted with several healthcare professionals over the following months. Unfortunately, the process was marked by delays and misdiagnoses, with some attributing my symptoms to overwork and stress. It wasn't until April 2021 that I received a definitive diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Following the diagnosis, my rheumatologist prescribed a variety of medications to manage my symptoms and improve my quality of life. Initially, I was prescribed Naproxen to alleviate joint pain and inflammation, but its effectiveness was limited. In June, after discussing with my healthcare provider, I transitioned to Methotrexate, which significantly improved my symptoms and allowed me to function better at work and home.

As my condition progressed, my treatment plan was adjusted to include Hydroxychloroquine sulfate in combination with Methotrexate. This combination proved more effective in controlling inflammation and slowing down the progression of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Additionally, intermittent courses of Prednisone were prescribed during flare-ups to manage severe symptoms.

Throughout this journey, I have worked closely with my rheumatologist, nurses, and pharmacists to monitor the effectiveness of each medication and adjust dosages as needed. While living with Rheumatoid Arthritis presents daily challenges, the right combination of medications has played a crucial role in managing my symptoms and allowing me to continue my work as a nurse and provide a nurturing environment for my children.
