On June 13, 2021, I, a 35-year-old single mother and nurse from Lithuania, began experiencing the first symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis. It started with persistent joint pain and swelling in my fingers, accompanied by morning stiffness that made it challenging to start my day.

Being in the healthcare field, I recognized the symptoms early on and sought medical attention promptly. After multiple visits to different specialists, including rheumatologists, I was officially diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis in August 2021. However, the road to diagnosis was not easy, as I encountered delays due to initial misdiagnoses of my symptoms as general joint strain or overuse.

Upon diagnosis, my healthcare team prescribed a range of medications to help manage my Rheumatoid Arthritis symptoms. Initially, I was prescribed Ibuprofen 400mg to alleviate pain and inflammation. While Ibuprofen provided some relief, the progression of my condition necessitated a more robust treatment approach.

Subsequently, I was started on Methotrexate, an immunosuppressant drug often used to treat Rheumatoid Arthritis. Methotrexate proved to be effective in slowing down the progression of the disease and reducing joint inflammation, enabling me to continue working and caring for my children more comfortably.

As my symptoms fluctuated, my rheumatologist adjusted my medication regimen. In addition to Methotrexate, I was prescribed Prednisone during flare-ups to manage acute inflammation and pain. While Prednisone provided rapid relief, its long-term use came with side effects that required careful monitoring.

Throughout my journey with Rheumatoid Arthritis, I consulted with rheumatologists, physiotherapists, and occupational therapists to address the various aspects of my condition comprehensively. As of now, the combination of Methotrexate and Prednisone has been instrumental in managing my symptoms and allowing me to maintain a fulfilling life despite the challenges posed by this chronic condition.
