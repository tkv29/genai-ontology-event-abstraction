I first noticed symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis on 13/11/2021 when I experienced persistent joint pain and swelling, especially in my hands and knees. As a busy software engineer, the discomfort made typing and coding challenging. 

After struggling with worsening symptoms, I consulted my primary care physician who referred me to a rheumatologist. The diagnosis process was lengthy, with multiple tests ruling out other conditions like osteoarthritis and lupus. Eventually, on 20/12/2021, I received confirmation of Rheumatoid Arthritis.

To manage my symptoms, I was prescribed a variety of medications tailored to my condition:
- Initially, I was prescribed Naproxen 250mg twice daily to reduce inflammation. While it provided some relief, the effects were minimal.
- My rheumatologist then switched me to Methotrexate 10mg weekly, a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug. This medication significantly improved my joint pain and stiffness, enhancing my daily functionality.
- To complement Methotrexate, I was also prescribed Prednisone 5mg daily during flare-ups. This corticosteroid effectively reduced inflammation, although long-term use raised concerns about side effects.

Throughout my journey, I consulted with my rheumatologist regularly for medication adjustments and check-ups. The comprehensive approach of Methotrexate and Prednisone has been key in managing my Rheumatoid Arthritis symptoms effectively, allowing me to continue working and caring for my family despite the challenges posed by the condition.
