On 13/02/2020, I, a 33-year-old software engineer from the Netherlands, started experiencing persistent joint pain, swelling, and stiffness. Initially, I attributed it to stress from work. However, the symptoms worsened over the next few weeks, affecting my daily activities and family time. Concerned, I consulted my family doctor on 27/03/2020, who suspected Rheumatoid Arthritis.

The diagnostic process was challenging, with various tests and consultations taking place. Due to the complexity of the disease, there were no misdiagnoses, but confirming Rheumatoid Arthritis took time. Finally, on 15/05/2020, a rheumatologist confirmed the diagnosis, starting treatment promptly.

For managing my symptoms, I was prescribed a combination of medications tailored to my condition. Initially, I was started on Naproxen 250mg twice daily for pain relief and inflammation control. While it provided some relief, the side effects were significant, leading to gastrointestinal discomfort.

Hence, my rheumatologist adjusted the regimen on 25/06/2020, introducing Methotrexate 10mg weekly alongside Naproxen to better manage the Rheumatoid Arthritis. The combination proved more effective, reducing joint pain and swelling significantly. However, I experienced mild nausea as a side effect.

Further adjustments were made on 30/07/2020, with the addition of Prednisone 5mg daily during flare-ups for short-term relief. This combination improved my quality of life, allowing me to work efficiently and enjoy family time without the debilitating symptoms.

Throughout my journey, I consulted with a family doctor initially, then a rheumatologist for the diagnosis and subsequent management of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Their expertise and guidance were crucial in finding the right medication combination to alleviate my symptoms and maintain a balance between work and family life.
