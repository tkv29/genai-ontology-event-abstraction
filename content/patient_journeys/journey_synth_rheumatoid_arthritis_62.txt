On 26/08/2023, I noticed the initial symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis â€“ joint pain, stiffness, and swelling. As a nurse and a single mother, these symptoms significantly impacted my ability to work effectively and care for my children. Seeking answers, I consulted my primary care physician, who referred me to a rheumatologist after suspecting an autoimmune condition. 

The diagnosis process was arduous, with some doctors initially attributing my symptoms to overwork and stress. Finally, on 15/09/2023, I was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis after extensive testing confirmed the presence of autoantibodies and joint damage.

For managing my symptoms, a combination of medications was prescribed:

- **Methotrexate**: Initiated on 20/09/2023, Methotrexate proved effective in controlling inflammation and slowing joint damage. However, it caused nausea initially.
- **Prednisone**: Introduced on 10/10/2023 for immediate symptom relief during flare-ups, Prednisone led to improved mobility but caused insomnia.
- **Hydroxychloroquine**: Added on 05/11/2023 to further reduce inflammation, Hydroxychloroquine helped manage my symptoms with minimal side effects.

Despite the challenges, consulting with a rheumatologist, an orthopedic specialist for joint damage assessment, and a physiotherapist for mobility exercises played crucial roles in my treatment journey.

Navigating the complexities of Rheumatoid Arthritis and its impact on my work and family life has been challenging, but with the right medications and a supportive healthcare team, I strive to find a balance between managing my condition and enjoying valuable time with my children.
