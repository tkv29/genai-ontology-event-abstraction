On 17/04/2022, I, a 35-year-old graphic designer from Slovakia, began experiencing debilitating joint pain and stiffness, primarily in my hands and feet. The pain gradually worsened over the following weeks, affecting my ability to work effectively and engage with my family. Concerned about these persistent symptoms, I consulted with my primary care physician on 25/05/2022, who referred me to a rheumatologist.

After a series of blood tests, imaging scans, and a thorough physical examination, I was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis on 14/06/2022. The road to diagnosis was hindered by initial misjudgments of my symptoms as temporary stress-related issues, causing a delay in receiving proper treatment.

Following the diagnosis, my rheumatologist prescribed a combination of medications to manage my Rheumatoid Arthritis symptoms effectively:

1. Methotrexate - Initiated on 22/06/2022, proved to be a cornerstone in slowing down the progression of the disease and reducing joint inflammation.

2. Prednisone - Prescribed as a short-term solution to alleviate acute pain and inflammation while waiting for Methotrexate to take full effect. Started on 29/06/2022.

3. Hydroxychloroquine sulfate - Added to my treatment regimen on 10/07/2022 to further control inflammation and improve overall symptoms.

4. Naproxen - Prescribed for immediate relief of pain and swelling during flare-ups. Started on 18/07/2022.

5. Physical therapy sessions - In addition to medications, I also engaged in regular physical therapy sessions to improve joint flexibility and functionality.

Over the following months, the combination of Methotrexate, Prednisone, Hydroxychloroquine sulfate, and Naproxen significantly reduced my joint pain, stiffness, and swelling. Regular consultations with my rheumatologist helped fine-tune the medication dosages to achieve optimal symptom management.

Although living with Rheumatoid Arthritis posed daily challenges, the prescribed medications played a crucial role in enhancing my quality of life, allowing me to continue pursuing my passion for graphic design while actively participating in my family life.
