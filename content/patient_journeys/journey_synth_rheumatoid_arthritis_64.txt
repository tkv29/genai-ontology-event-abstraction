On the 20th of January 2022, I, a 35-year-old software engineer from France, started experiencing joint pain and stiffness in my hands. Initially, I brushed it off as work-related strain. However, over the following weeks, the pain intensified and spread to my wrists, knees, and ankles, making it challenging to perform daily activities. Concerned, I consulted my primary care physician, who suspected Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA).

The diagnosis process was challenging, with several tests and consultations with rheumatologists. Due to the atypical onset of symptoms in a male of my age, there were misdiagnoses of other conditions like carpal tunnel syndrome and overuse injuries, leading to delays in receiving the appropriate treatment. Finally, in March 2022, after a series of blood tests and imaging scans, I received a confirmed diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis.

My treatment journey began with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like Ibuprofen and Naproxen to manage pain and inflammation. While these provided temporary relief, the progression of RA necessitated disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). I was prescribed Methotrexate initially, which helped slow down the disease activity but caused significant nausea and fatigue.

As the symptoms persisted, my rheumatologist introduced Hydroxychloroquine and Prednisone in combination with Methotrexate. This combination was more effective in controlling inflammation and improving my joint mobility. Despite the side effects like upset stomach and weight gain from Prednisone, the overall impact on managing RA symptoms was positive.

Over time, adjustments were made to the dosages and combinations of medications to find the right balance between controlling inflammation and minimizing side effects. The healthcare professionals I consulted included rheumatologists, physical therapists, and nutritionists, all playing vital roles in managing my RA effectively.

Through this journey, the medications played a crucial role in alleviating pain, reducing inflammation, and preserving joint function, allowing me to continue working and being present for my family. The support from my healthcare team and the efficacy of the prescribed medications have been instrumental in maintaining my quality of life despite living with Rheumatoid Arthritis.
