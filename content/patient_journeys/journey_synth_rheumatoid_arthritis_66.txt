On 24th November 2021, I, a 35-year-old software engineer from Bosnia and Herzegovina, began experiencing joint pain, stiffness, and swelling that significantly impacted my daily life. These symptoms gradually worsened over the following weeks, affecting my ability to work efficiently and spend quality time with my family.

Concerned about my symptoms, I consulted a rheumatologist in mid-December 2021, who suspected Rheumatoid Arthritis. However, due to the complexity and variability of RA symptoms, the diagnosis process was challenging and involved ruling out other conditions like osteoarthritis and lupus. By late January 2022, I received confirmation of Rheumatoid Arthritis following detailed blood tests and imaging studies.

Upon diagnosis, my healthcare team prescribed a tailored treatment plan to manage my RA symptoms effectively. Initially, I was prescribed Naproxen 250mg twice a day to alleviate pain and inflammation. While Naproxen provided some relief, the symptoms persisted, leading to the addition of Methotrexate 10mg weekly in February 2022 to target the underlying inflammation.

As my symptoms continued to impact my daily life, my rheumatologist adjusted my treatment regimen in March 2022, substituting Naproxen with Meloxicam 15mg once daily for improved pain management. The introduction of Meloxicam significantly alleviated joint pain and stiffness, allowing me to navigate work and family responsibilities with greater ease.

Throughout my journey with Rheumatoid Arthritis, I have consulted with a rheumatologist and a physiotherapist regularly to monitor my condition and adjust treatment as needed. The collaborative efforts of healthcare professionals and the tailored medication regimen have played a vital role in managing my RA symptoms effectively, improving my quality of life, and allowing me to pursue both my career and family aspirations with confidence.
