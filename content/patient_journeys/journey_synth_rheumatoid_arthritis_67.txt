On the 14th of April 2021, I, as a 35-year-old single mother working as a nurse, began experiencing the initial symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis. What started as joint pain and stiffness in my fingers and wrists soon progressed to fatigue and general malaise, making my daily tasks at work and home increasingly challenging.

Seeking answers, I consulted my primary care physician, who initially suspected overwork and advised rest. However, as my symptoms persisted and worsened over the following weeks, I sought a second opinion from a rheumatologist. Finally, on the 25th of May, after a series of blood tests, imaging studies, and a physical examination, I received the definitive diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis.

In terms of medications, my journey with Rheumatoid Arthritis began with a combination of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like Ibuprofen and Naproxen to manage pain and inflammation. Although these medications provided some relief, the progression of my condition necessitated a shift to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) like Methotrexate and Hydroxychloroquine sulfate to slow the disease activity and prevent joint damage.

As the disease continued to impact my daily life, my rheumatologist introduced biologic therapies such as Tofacitinib citrate to target the underlying causes of Rheumatoid Arthritis more effectively. Each medication had its own level of effectiveness in managing my symptoms, with some providing better pain relief while others focusing on disease progression.

Throughout my journey, I consulted with a team of healthcare professionals, including rheumatologists, physiotherapists, and occupational therapists, to address the various aspects of managing Rheumatoid Arthritis and its impact on my life as a single mother and healthcare provider. Despite the challenges, the right combination of medications and support from healthcare professionals has helped me maintain a balance between work, motherhood, and managing my Rheumatoid Arthritis symptoms.
