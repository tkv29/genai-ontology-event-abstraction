I first experienced symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis on November 19, 2020. What started as occasional joint pain gradually worsened, leading to stiffness, swelling, and difficulty in movement, impacting my ability to work as a nurse and care for my children effectively.

The journey to diagnosis was challenging. Initially, my symptoms were mistaken for general fatigue and stress due to my demanding job. However, persistent joint issues led to further investigations and ultimately, a diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis was confirmed in February 2021 after consulting with a rheumatologist.

Upon diagnosis, a comprehensive treatment plan was developed, including a regimen of medications to manage my symptoms. Initially, I was prescribed Methotrexate to target the inflammation and slow down the progression of the disease. While it took some time to show its full effectiveness, Methotrexate significantly reduced joint pain and swelling, allowing me to regain some mobility and function in my daily life.

As my condition required more aggressive treatment, my healthcare team introduced Leflunomide alongside Methotrexate in June 2021. This combination proved more effective in controlling inflammation and preventing joint damage, improving my overall quality of life.

Additionally, to manage acute flare-ups and provide relief from severe pain, I was prescribed Naproxen as needed. Naproxen quickly alleviated intense pain during flare-ups, allowing me to continue working and caring for my children effectively.

Throughout this journey, I collaborated closely with my rheumatologist and primary care physician to monitor the effectiveness of the medications, adjust dosages when necessary, and address any side effects promptly. The combination of Methotrexate, Leflunomide, and Naproxen has helped me manage my Rheumatoid Arthritis symptoms effectively, enabling me to fulfill my roles as a nurse and a devoted mother while maintaining a good quality of life.
