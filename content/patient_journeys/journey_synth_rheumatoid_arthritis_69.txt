I first started experiencing symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis on September 8, 2021. It began with persistent joint pain in my fingers and wrists, which gradually worsened over the following weeks, making it difficult for me to perform daily tasks without discomfort.

The process of getting diagnosed was a challenging journey. Initially, I visited my primary care physician who prescribed pain relievers like Ibuprofen and Naproxen to manage the discomfort. However, as the pain persisted and spread to other joints, I was referred to a rheumatologist for further evaluation. It took several visits and tests, including blood work and imaging scans, before I received a confirmed diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis in late October 2021.

Following the diagnosis, my rheumatologist prescribed a combination of medications to help manage my symptoms and slow down the progression of the disease. I was started on Methotrexate, which proved to be effective in reducing joint inflammation and pain. In addition to Methotrexate, I was also prescribed Prednisone to help with flare-ups and Hydroxychloroquine to further control the autoimmune response.

As my condition required more aggressive treatment, my rheumatologist introduced Tofacitinib alongside Methotrexate to better manage the disease activity and prevent further joint damage. Despite the side effects like nausea and fatigue, the combination of these medications significantly improved my quality of life and allowed me to continue working and caring for my family.

Throughout my journey with Rheumatoid Arthritis, I have consulted with a team of healthcare professionals, including my rheumatologist, who have been instrumental in tailoring my treatment plan to suit my specific needs. Their expertise and support have been invaluable in helping me navigate this chronic condition and find relief through appropriate medication management.
