I first noticed the initial symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis in early September 2020, with persistent joint pain, swelling, and stiffness, especially in my hands and wrists. As a software engineer working long hours, the discomfort made it challenging to type and work effectively. By mid-September, the symptoms had worsened, affecting my productivity and family time.

Seeking a diagnosis, I consulted with a rheumatologist in late September 2020. Unfortunately, the process was not straightforward. Initially, my symptoms were dismissed as overuse strain due to my demanding job. However, as the pain persisted, further tests confirmed Rheumatoid Arthritis in late October 2020.

Upon diagnosis, my healthcare provider prescribed a combination of medications to manage the symptoms effectively. Initially, I was started on Naproxen 500mg twice daily to reduce inflammation and pain in the joints. While it provided some relief, the side effects were bothersome. The medication was then switched to Meloxicam 15mg once daily, which proved to be more tolerable while effectively managing the symptoms.

As my condition progressed, Methotrexate was introduced in early December 2020 to slow the progression of Rheumatoid Arthritis and prevent joint damage. The combination of Meloxicam and Methotrexate significantly improved my quality of life by reducing pain and inflammation, allowing me to work more comfortably and engage with my family actively.

Throughout this journey, I consulted with a team of healthcare professionals, including rheumatologists, general practitioners, and physiotherapists, who played a vital role in managing my condition. Regular follow-ups and adjustments to my medication regime have been essential in keeping my symptoms under control and maintaining a balance between work and family life.
