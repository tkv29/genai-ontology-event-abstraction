I first noticed symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis in November 2020 when I experienced persistent joint pain in my hands and feet, accompanied by swelling and stiffness, making it challenging to work on my designs as a graphic designer. These symptoms gradually worsened over a few weeks, affecting my ability to spend quality time with my family due to the constant discomfort.

Seeking medical advice, I consulted with my primary care physician in December 2020, who suspected Rheumatoid Arthritis but recommended further evaluation by a rheumatologist. Due to the limited availability of specialists on the Faroe Islands, I faced a delay in getting an appointment, leading to increased frustration and difficulty in managing my increasing pain and decreased mobility.

In February 2021, I finally met with a rheumatologist who confirmed the diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis based on blood tests, imaging scans, and a physical examination. Initially, I was prescribed Naproxen 250mg twice daily to manage the pain and inflammation, which provided moderate relief but led to frequent stomach discomfort.

As my symptoms persisted, in March 2021, my rheumatologist added Methotrexate 15mg weekly to my treatment regimen to slow down the progression of the disease and alleviate joint damage. The combination of Naproxen and Methotrexate significantly improved my symptoms, allowing me to work more comfortably and engage in family activities with reduced pain and swelling.

Throughout my journey, I worked closely with my rheumatologist, who monitored my progress, adjusted dosages, and addressed any concerns I had about side effects or efficacy of the medications. Despite the challenges of balancing work, family, and managing Rheumatoid Arthritis, the support of my healthcare team and the effectiveness of the prescribed medications have played a crucial role in improving my quality of life.
