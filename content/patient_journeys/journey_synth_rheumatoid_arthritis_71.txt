On October 3, 2023, I, a 35-year-old graphic designer from Hungary, began experiencing joint pain, stiffness, and swelling, particularly in my hands and feet. Concerned about these symptoms, I sought medical advice. Initially, the pain was mild and intermittent, but over the next few weeks, it progressively worsened, affecting my daily activities and work.

After visiting my primary care physician, I was referred to a rheumatologist. The diagnostic process involved a series of blood tests, physical exams, and imaging studies. Unfortunately, the diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis was delayed due to overlapping symptoms with other conditions like fibromyalgia and initial inconclusive tests.

Finally, on November 21, 2023, I received a definitive diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis. My rheumatologist prescribed a tailored treatment plan to manage my symptoms and prevent disease progression. Initially, I was started on Methotrexate, a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD), which helped to reduce inflammation and slow joint damage. I experienced some nausea and fatigue as common side effects but found the medication significantly improved my joint pain after a few weeks.

As my condition required further management, my rheumatologist introduced Leflunomide in combination with Methotrexate in January 2024. This combination proved more effective in controlling inflammation and stiffness, allowing me to function better at work and home. I did experience some hair thinning as a side effect, but the benefits outweighed the drawbacks.

Throughout my journey, I have regularly consulted with my rheumatologist for medication adjustments and monitoring of my disease activity. The healthcare team's support and the personalized medication regimen have been instrumental in improving my symptoms, maintaining my quality of life, and preparing for the arrival of my first child. I am grateful for the advancements in Rheumatoid Arthritis treatment that have allowed me to navigate this new chapter with hope and positivity.
