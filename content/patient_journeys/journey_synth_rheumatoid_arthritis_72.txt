I first noticed symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis on November 16, 2021, experiencing joint pain and stiffness in my hands and feet. As a busy doctor and single parent, these symptoms significantly impacted my ability to work and care for my children. Despite initially attributing the pain to stress and overwork, the persistent nature of the symptoms led me to seek medical attention.

After consulting with my primary care physician, I was referred to a rheumatologist for further evaluation. The diagnosis process was lengthy, involving blood tests, imaging scans, and physical examinations. Unfortunately, there were delays due to the complexity of my schedule, and at one point, a misdiagnosis of osteoarthritis was discussed.

Finally, on March 2, 2022, I received a confirmed diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis. The rheumatologist prescribed a combination of medications to manage my symptoms and slow the progression of the disease. Initially, I was started on Naproxen to alleviate inflammation and pain. While it provided some relief, the symptoms persisted, leading to the addition of Methotrexate on March 15, 2022.

Methotrexate proved to be a game-changer, significantly reducing inflammation and joint stiffness. However, due to persistent symptoms, my rheumatologist introduced Hydroxychloroquine on April 5, 2022, which further improved my quality of life. The combination of Naproxen, Methotrexate, and Hydroxychloroquine has been effective in managing my Rheumatoid Arthritis symptoms, allowing me to balance work and family responsibilities more comfortably.

Throughout my journey, I consulted with a rheumatologist, an orthopedic specialist, and a physiotherapist to ensure comprehensive care. Their expertise and support have been invaluable in my treatment plan. While living with Rheumatoid Arthritis presents challenges, the right combination of medications has significantly improved my daily life and well-being.
