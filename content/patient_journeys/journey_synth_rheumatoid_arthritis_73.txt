On September 1, 2021, I, a 35-year-old single mother from Portugal working as a nurse, began experiencing joint pain, stiffness, and swelling. Initially attributing these symptoms to work-related stress, I ignored them until they significantly worsened. By mid-September, the pain became unbearable, affecting my ability to care for my children.

Feeling concerned, I consulted my primary care physician on September 20, who suspected Rheumatoid Arthritis but advised further tests. Blood work and imaging confirmed the diagnosis on October 5, 2021. However, due to a shortage of specialists, I faced a delay in seeing a rheumatologist until October 25.

Upon consultation, the rheumatologist prescribed a combination of medications to manage my symptoms. Initially, I was started on Naproxen 500mg twice daily to reduce inflammation and manage pain. While it provided some relief, the side effects were bothersome, leading to a switch to Meloxicam 15mg daily in November 2021.

As the disease progressed, Methotrexate 20mg weekly was added in December 2021 to slow down joint damage and control inflammation. Initially, the side effects were challenging, but with dosage adjustments, it became more manageable. In January 2022, Hydroxychloroquine 200mg daily was introduced to complement Methotrexate's effects.

Throughout my journey, communication with my healthcare team, including my primary care physician and rheumatologist, was crucial in tailoring my medication regimen. While each medication had its side effects, the combination significantly improved my symptoms, allowing me to continue working and caring for my children. Despite the challenges of living with Rheumatoid Arthritis, the medications have been instrumental in maintaining my quality of life.
