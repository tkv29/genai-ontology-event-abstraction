I first noticed the initial symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis in April 2022 when I experienced persistent joint pain and swelling in my hands, particularly in the mornings. As a busy 35-year-old marketing manager, the discomfort made it challenging to type and engage in activities with my two children.

The journey to diagnosis was arduous. After several visits to my general practitioner, I was initially misdiagnosed with general joint strain and prescribed over-the-counter pain relievers like Ibuprofen, which provided minimal relief. Frustrated by the lack of improvement, I sought a second opinion from a rheumatologist.

In June 2022, I was officially diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis. The rheumatologist prescribed Methotrexate to manage the inflammation and joint pain. Initially, Methotrexate improved my symptoms, but over time, its effectiveness waned, prompting a switch to Leflunomide in September 2022.

Leflunomide showed promise in alleviating my joint pain and stiffness, although I experienced some gastrointestinal side effects. To address this, my rheumatologist introduced Hydroxychloroquine in conjunction with Leflunomide in December 2022. This combination therapy significantly improved my symptoms and allowed me to engage more actively in both work and family life.

Throughout this journey, I consulted with a rheumatologist regularly to monitor my progress and adjust medications as needed. The support and expertise of the healthcare professionals were crucial in finding the right combination of medications to manage my Rheumatoid Arthritis effectively.

Overall, the medications prescribed, particularly the combination of Leflunomide and Hydroxychloroquine, have played a vital role in enhancing my quality of life by reducing pain and inflammation, allowing me to better balance my career and family responsibilities.
