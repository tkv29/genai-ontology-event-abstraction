I first noticed symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis on August 26, 2022. It started with joint pain and stiffness in my hands and feet, making it difficult to perform daily tasks at work and home. As a 35-year-old software engineer, the sudden onset of these symptoms significantly impacted my productivity and family life.

The process of getting diagnosed was challenging. Initially, I dismissed the symptoms as stress-related due to my demanding job and family responsibilities. However, as the pain persisted, I consulted a general practitioner who suspected Rheumatoid Arthritis but recommended further evaluation by a rheumatologist. Unfortunately, due to a busy schedule, I faced delays in scheduling an appointment, leading to added anxiety and discomfort.

Upon consulting a rheumatologist, I received a confirmed diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis in late September 2022. The healthcare professionals I consulted included my general practitioner, the rheumatologist, and a pharmacist who provided detailed information on prescribed medications.

For managing my Rheumatoid Arthritis symptoms, I was prescribed a combination of medications:

- Methotrexate: Initiated in October 2022, Methotrexate has been effective in reducing joint inflammation and pain. However, I experienced mild nausea as a side effect.

- Prednisone: Prescribed in conjunction with Methotrexate, Prednisone helped alleviate acute flare-ups, providing quick relief from severe joint pain.

- Hydroxychloroquine: Introduced in November 2022, Hydroxychloroquine has been beneficial in improving overall joint mobility and reducing the frequency of flare-ups.

- Naproxen: Prescribed as needed for acute pain relief, Naproxen has been effective in managing sudden onset joint pain, enhancing my daily functionality.

Overall, the prescribed medications have significantly improved my quality of life, allowing me to balance work and family responsibilities more effectively. While adjusting to the side effects has been challenging, the relief provided by these medications has been invaluable in managing my Rheumatoid Arthritis symptoms.
