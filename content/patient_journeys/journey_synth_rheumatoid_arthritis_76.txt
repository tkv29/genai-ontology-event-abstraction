On May 19, 2020, I, a 35-year-old accountant from Poland, started experiencing the initial symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis. It began with persistent joint pain, swelling, and stiffness in my hands and knees, making it challenging to carry out daily tasks both at work and at home. As the symptoms progressed over the following weeks, I also noticed fatigue and a general feeling of malaise.

Seeking answers, I consulted my family doctor in June 2020, who suspected Rheumatoid Arthritis due to the nature of my symptoms. However, to confirm the diagnosis, I was referred to a rheumatologist. The process of getting an appointment and undergoing tests caused a delay, during which the symptoms worsened, affecting my ability to work efficiently and be present for my family.

Finally, in August 2020, after multiple consultations and tests, I received a confirmed diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis. The rheumatologist prescribed a treatment plan to manage the condition, starting with Ibuprofen 200mg daily to alleviate pain and inflammation. While Ibuprofen provided some relief initially, the progression of the disease demanded a more comprehensive approach.

In September 2020, my medication was adjusted to include Methotrexate 15mg weekly, aiming to slow down the disease progression and reduce joint damage. This addition significantly improved my symptoms, allowing me to function better at work and engage more actively with my family. Despite some initial side effects like nausea and fatigue, the benefits outweighed the challenges.

Throughout this journey, I consulted with my family doctor for regular check-ups and adjustments to the medication plan. The combination of Ibuprofen and Methotrexate proved effective in managing my Rheumatoid Arthritis symptoms, enabling me to balance work and family life more comfortably. While the road to diagnosis was challenging, finding the right medications has been a crucial step in my ongoing battle with this condition.
