On 21/03/2020, I, a 35-year-old accountant from Luxembourg, was hit by sudden joint pain in my hands and feet. As the weeks passed, the pain intensified, accompanied by morning stiffness and swelling. By early April, I struggled with fatigue and found it increasingly challenging to balance work and family responsibilities.

After weeks of discomfort, I finally sought medical help in late April. Initially misdiagnosed with general joint strain, I faced delays in the correct diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis. It wasn't until mid-May that a rheumatologist confirmed the condition, explaining the chronic nature and potential impact on daily life.

The prescribed medications have been crucial in managing my symptoms. Initially starting with Ibuprofen for pain relief, its effectiveness waned over time. Transitioning to Naproxen provided better relief but came with mild gastrointestinal issues. Methotrexate was introduced in June, significantly reducing inflammation and pain. By August, Leflunomide was added to complement Methotrexate, enhancing overall symptom management.

Consultations with rheumatologists and general practitioners have guided my treatment journey. The healthcare professionals played a vital role in adjusting medications based on my response and side effects, improving my quality of life and ability to fulfill work and family commitments. The journey with Rheumatoid Arthritis has been challenging, but with the right medications and healthcare support, I strive to lead a fulfilling life while managing this chronic condition.
