On January 20, 2023, I noticed the initial symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis: joint pain, stiffness, and swelling in my hands and feet. As a 35-year-old architect trying to balance a demanding career and family life, these symptoms quickly became debilitating. 

Seeking help, I consulted with a rheumatologist on February 5, 2023. The road to diagnosis was challenging, with initial misdiagnoses delaying the accurate identification of Rheumatoid Arthritis until March 10, 2023. 

Upon diagnosis, my healthcare provider prescribed a combination of medications to manage my symptoms. Initially, I was started on Ibuprofen 200mg twice daily to alleviate pain and inflammation. While it provided some relief, the symptoms persisted, leading to the addition of Methotrexate 15mg weekly on April 1, 2023, to slow disease progression. 

Despite these efforts, the disease continued to affect my daily life, prompting the introduction of Hydroxychloroquine 200mg daily on April 25, 2023, to target inflammation more effectively. Gradually, the combination of Methotrexate and Hydroxychloroquine improved my joint symptoms and quality of life. 

Regular follow-ups with my rheumatologist helped monitor the effectiveness of the medications. Additional adjustments were made in July, with the introduction of Prednisone 5mg as a short-term solution during flare-ups. This combination of medications has allowed me to better manage my condition and continue providing for my family without compromising my health.

Through the expertise of my rheumatologist and the tailored medication regimen, I have found a balance that enables me to lead a fulfilling life despite living with Rheumatoid Arthritis.
