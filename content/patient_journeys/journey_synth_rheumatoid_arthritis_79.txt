On the 18th of October 2022, I, a 35-year-old single mother working as a nurse, noticed the initial symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis. It began with persistent joint pain, swelling, and stiffness, primarily affecting my hands and knees, making it challenging to carry out my nursing duties and care for my two young children effectively.

The process of getting diagnosed was arduous. Initially, some symptoms were mistaken for work-related strain, delaying the official diagnosis by a few weeks. However, persistent pain led me to consult with a rheumatologist on the 7th of November 2022, who confirmed Rheumatoid Arthritis after thorough testing and analysis.

Upon diagnosis, I was prescribed a combination of medications to manage my symptoms effectively. Initially, I was put on Naproxen 500mg daily for pain and inflammation. This helped alleviate the swelling and discomfort, allowing me to function better at work and home. However, as the disease progressed, Methotrexate was introduced on the 20th of December 2022 to slow down joint damage and disease progression. The Methotrexate regimen significantly improved my quality of life by reducing flare-ups and increasing mobility.

Consulting regularly with my rheumatologist was crucial in monitoring the effectiveness of the medications and making necessary adjustments. Additionally, I incorporated lifestyle changes and physical therapy to complement the medication regimen.

Overall, while the journey with Rheumatoid Arthritis presented challenges, the timely diagnosis, effective medication management including Naproxen and Methotrexate, and the support of healthcare professionals significantly improved my symptoms and daily functioning, enabling me to continue caring for my children and fulfilling my responsibilities as a nurse.
