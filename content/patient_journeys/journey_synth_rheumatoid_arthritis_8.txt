On 22/06/2020, I experienced the first symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis â€“ joint pain, stiffness, and swelling. Being a 35-year-old accountant in Albania, the demanding workload made it challenging to initially attribute these symptoms to a serious condition. As the discomfort persisted and impacted my daily life, I sought medical advice.

After consulting a general practitioner, I was referred to a rheumatologist. The diagnosis process involved blood tests, imaging, and physical examinations, culminating in a confirmed diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis on 15/07/2020. There were no misdiagnoses, but the process took almost three weeks due to scheduling constraints.

For managing my Rheumatoid Arthritis symptoms, the healthcare professionals prescribed a combination of medications. Initially, I was put on Ibuprofen 400mg for pain and inflammation. Though it provided some relief, the effectiveness waned over time. On 01/08/2020, my treatment plan was adjusted to include Methotrexate 10mg weekly, alongside Hydroxychloroquine 200mg daily. This combination significantly improved my symptoms, enhancing my mobility and reducing joint tenderness.

As my condition progressed, the rheumatologist incorporated Prednisone 5mg for flare-ups, ensuring timely management. The holistic approach of combining disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) with anti-inflammatories proved beneficial. Regular follow-ups with the healthcare professionals enabled tailored adjustments to optimize the medication regimen.

Through this journey, the Medications have played a pivotal role in managing my Rheumatoid Arthritis, improving my quality of life, and allowing me to continue my professional responsibilities despite the challenges posed by the condition.
