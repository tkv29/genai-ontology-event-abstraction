On 15/01/2023, I, a 35-year-old accountant from Montenegro, first noticed the early signs of Rheumatoid Arthritis - joint pain, stiffness, and swelling in my hands and feet. The symptoms gradually worsened and started affecting my daily life, making it challenging to work long hours to provide for my family.

Seeking answers, I consulted with my primary care physician who referred me to a rheumatologist. After multiple tests and evaluations, I was officially diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis on 02/02/2023, a process that took a few weeks due to the complexity of the condition.

Initially, I was prescribed Ibuprofen 200mg to manage the pain and inflammation. While it provided temporary relief, the symptoms persisted. Consequently, my rheumatologist added Methotrexate 10mg weekly to slow down the progression of the disease.

Over the next few months, despite the medication regimen, my symptoms continued to impact my daily life significantly. My rheumatologist then introduced Tofacitinib 5mg daily, which proved to be more effective in managing the inflammation and pain.

As my condition progressed, my healthcare team decided to combine Tofacitinib with Prednisone 5mg daily for better disease control. This combination therapy not only helped in reducing joint damage but also improved my overall quality of life.

Throughout my journey with Rheumatoid Arthritis, I have been under the care of my rheumatologist, who closely monitors my progress and adjusts the medication as needed to ensure I can continue providing for my family while making time for my loved ones. Through this challenging experience, the right medication has been crucial in helping me secure a brighter future for my children despite the sacrifices and long hours at work.
