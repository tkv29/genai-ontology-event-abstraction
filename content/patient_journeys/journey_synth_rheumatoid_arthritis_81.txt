On the 17th of February 2021, I, a 35-year-old software engineer from Portugal, experienced my first symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis shortly after moving to a new city for a job opportunity. The initial signs were subtle joint pain and stiffness in my hands, making typing and holding objects challenging. As weeks passed, the discomfort spread to my wrists, knees, and ankles, impacting both my work and family life.

Seeking answers, I consulted a rheumatologist in late March after my symptoms persisted and intensified. Initially, my condition was misdiagnosed as general joint pain due to stress from the recent move. However, as the pain became more debilitating, further tests revealed the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis in mid-April.

Since diagnosis, I have been prescribed a combination of medications to manage my symptoms. Initially, I was started on Naproxen for pain relief, which provided moderate relief but was not sufficient to control the inflammation. Subsequently, Methotrexate and Hydroxychloroquine were added in May, leading to significant improvement in joint pain and swelling. These medications, especially Methotrexate, have been effective in managing my Rheumatoid Arthritis symptoms and improving my quality of life.

In addition to the rheumatologist, I have also consulted with a physiotherapist to incorporate exercises to improve joint flexibility and strength. The support of my spouse has been invaluable throughout this journey, helping me balance work responsibilities, family life, and the challenges posed by the condition.
