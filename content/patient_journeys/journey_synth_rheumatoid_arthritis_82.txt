On August 18, 2021, I, a 35-year-old single mother from Bosnia and Herzegovina, first experienced symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Initially, I noticed persistent joint pain and swelling in my hands, making it challenging for me to carry out my duties as a nurse and care for my two young children. As the pain intensified over the following weeks, I also began to struggle with stiffness in the mornings and general fatigue.

Seeking medical help, I consulted my primary care physician who suspected Rheumatoid Arthritis based on my symptoms and family history. However, the official diagnosis took some time due to the complexity of the condition and the need for extensive testing to rule out other possibilities. After several tests and consultations with a rheumatologist, I was finally diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis in early October 2021.

Upon diagnosis, my healthcare team prescribed a combination of medications to manage my symptoms and improve my quality of life. Initially, I was started on Naproxen to help with pain and inflammation. While it provided some relief, the side effects were noticeable, leading to a switch to Methotrexate in late October. Methotrexate proved to be more effective in controlling the progression of the disease and reducing inflammation, but it came with its own set of side effects like nausea and fatigue.

As the months went by, my rheumatologist introduced Hydroxychloroquine in conjunction with Methotrexate to enhance its effects. The combination proved to be more beneficial, offering better pain management and improved mobility. Despite the ongoing challenges of balancing work, childcare, and dealing with a chronic condition, the medications have played a crucial role in helping me maintain a semblance of normalcy in my daily life.

Throughout this journey, I have been supported by my primary care physician, rheumatologist, and a dedicated team of healthcare professionals who have been instrumental in monitoring my progress and adjusting my treatment plan as needed. Despite the initial struggles and uncertainties, the medications prescribed have been pivotal in managing my Rheumatoid Arthritis symptoms and allowing me to continue providing for and caring for my family.
