I first noticed the initial symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis on September 15, 2020. It began with persistent joint pain in my fingers, followed by swelling and stiffness that made it challenging to perform everyday tasks. As an architect, the pain in my hands was particularly debilitating.

The process of getting diagnosed was arduous. Initially, the symptoms were attributed to overwork due to my demanding job and caring for my family. However, after several months of escalating pain and limited mobility, I sought a second opinion from a rheumatologist.

After a series of tests, including blood work and imaging scans, I was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis on February 10, 2021. The delay in diagnosis was frustrating, but finally having a name for my condition brought some clarity.

Following the diagnosis, I was prescribed a treatment plan to manage my symptoms and slow disease progression. I started with Ibuprofen to alleviate pain and inflammation. While it provided temporary relief, the effects were not long-lasting.

In April 2021, my rheumatologist introduced Methotrexate to address the underlying cause of Rheumatoid Arthritis. The medication helped reduce joint inflammation and pain significantly, allowing me to function better at work and home. However, it came with side effects like nausea and fatigue.

In June 2021, due to persistent symptoms, my medication was adjusted to include Prednisone for short-term relief during flare-ups. The combination of Methotrexate and Prednisone has been more effective in managing my symptoms, although I continue to experience occasional pain and stiffness.

Throughout my journey, I consulted with a rheumatologist specializing in autoimmune diseases who played a crucial role in tailoring my medication regimen. While managing Rheumatoid Arthritis remains a daily challenge, the prescribed medications have undoubtedly improved my quality of life and enabled me to continue balancing work and family responsibilities.
