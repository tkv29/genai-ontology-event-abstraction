On the 25th of July 2022, I, a 34-year-old marketing manager from Luxembourg and a single mother of two, began experiencing the first signs of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Initially, I noticed stiffness in my joints, particularly in the mornings, which gradually progressed to persistent joint pain and swelling in my hands and knees over the following weeks.

Concerned about these symptoms affecting my ability to care for my children and perform at work, I sought medical help. After several consultations with various healthcare professionals, including my primary care physician, a rheumatologist, and an orthopedic specialist, I received a confirmed diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis in September 2022.

The process of getting diagnosed was challenging, with initial misdiagnoses of minor joint strain and overexertion. However, persistent symptoms and further testing revealed the underlying autoimmune nature of my condition.

Upon diagnosis, my rheumatologist prescribed a combination of medications to manage my Rheumatoid Arthritis symptoms effectively. Initially, I was prescribed Ibuprofen and Naproxen to alleviate pain and reduce inflammation. While these medications provided some relief, they were not sufficient in controlling the progression of the disease.

As the condition advanced, my treatment plan was adjusted to include Methotrexate and Hydroxychloroquine to slow the disease activity and protect my joints from further damage. Additionally, I was prescribed Prednisone during disease flares to manage acute symptoms effectively.

Throughout my journey, the medications have played a crucial role in managing my Rheumatoid Arthritis symptoms and improving my quality of life. Methotrexate and Hydroxychloroquine combination have been particularly effective in reducing inflammation and joint pain, allowing me to continue working and caring for my children despite the challenges posed by this chronic condition.

Regular consultations with my rheumatologist and adherence to the prescribed medication regimen have been instrumental in maintaining disease control and preserving my overall well-being amidst the demands of a busy life as a single mother and professional in the marketing industry.
