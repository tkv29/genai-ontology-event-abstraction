I first noticed the symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis on September 15, 2021, when I experienced persistent joint pain and swelling in my hands and knees. As an architect with a busy schedule, these symptoms significantly impacted my ability to work efficiently and spend quality time with my family. 

The process of getting diagnosed was challenging due to initial misdiagnoses of the joint pain as regular wear and tear from my job. However, after persistent symptoms and a thorough evaluation by a rheumatologist in late October, I received a confirmed diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Following the diagnosis, I was prescribed a combination of medications to manage my symptoms effectively. Initially, I started with Ibuprofen 400mg twice a day for pain relief and inflammation reduction. While Ibuprofen provided some relief, it wasn't sufficient to control the progression of my condition.

In December, my rheumatologist introduced Methotrexate 10mg weekly alongside Ibuprofen to slow down the disease progression. The combination of Methotrexate and Ibuprofen proved to be more effective in managing my pain and swelling. Despite some mild side effects, the overall impact on my symptoms was positive.

In February 2022, due to persistent symptoms, my medication was adjusted to include Hydroxychloroquine 200mg daily in addition to Methotrexate and Ibuprofen. This new combination further improved my joint pain and swelling, allowing me to function more comfortably both at work and at home.

Throughout this journey, I consulted with a rheumatologist, who oversaw my treatment plan and made necessary adjustments based on my response to different medications. The healthcare professionals I worked with played a crucial role in helping me manage my Rheumatoid Arthritis effectively and maintain a good quality of life amidst the challenges posed by the condition.
