I first experienced symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis on November 22, 2022, when I noticed morning stiffness in my joints, especially in my hands and feet. Over the following weeks, the stiffness progressed, accompanied by joint pain, swelling, and fatigue, making it difficult to carry out my daily tasks as a software engineer and spend quality time with my family.

The road to diagnosis was challenging, with initial visits to my primary care physician resulting in misdiagnoses of overexertion and vitamin deficiencies. It wasn't until December 15, 2022, when I sought a second opinion from a rheumatologist after persistent symptoms, that I was correctly diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Upon diagnosis, my healthcare team prescribed a combination of medications to manage my symptoms effectively. Initially, I was prescribed Ibuprofen to help with pain and inflammation, followed by Methotrexate to slow down the progression of the disease. While Ibuprofen provided some relief, Methotrexate significantly improved my joint pain and swelling, allowing me to function better at work and home.

As my condition required more management, my rheumatologist introduced Hydroxychloroquine sulfate in March 2023 to complement the effects of Methotrexate. This addition further enhanced the control of my symptoms, improving my overall quality of life. Regular monitoring and consultations with my rheumatologist have been crucial in adjusting the medication dosage and assessing their effectiveness.

Throughout this journey, the support and expertise of my rheumatologist have been invaluable in managing my Rheumatoid Arthritis effectively. The combination of Methotrexate, Hydroxychloroquine sulfate, and Ibuprofen has played a vital role in controlling my symptoms, allowing me to navigate the challenges of balancing work and family life with greater ease.
