I first noticed unusual stiffness and swelling in my joints on 28/11/2022, which prompted me to seek medical advice. Over the following weeks, the symptoms progressed, affecting my ability to work effectively as an accountant. After consulting with my primary care physician on 15/12/2022, I was referred to a rheumatologist for further evaluation.

The diagnostic process was challenging, as initial tests did not provide a clear indication of Rheumatoid Arthritis. There were concerns about potential misdiagnoses, and it wasn't until 10/01/2023 that a conclusive diagnosis was made, ruling out other conditions based on a combination of physical examination, blood tests, and imaging studies.

Upon confirmation of Rheumatoid Arthritis, my treatment plan included a variety of medications to manage the symptoms. Initially, I was prescribed Ibuprofen 200mg to alleviate the pain and inflammation. While it provided some relief, the symptoms persisted, leading to the addition of Methotrexate 10mg on 20/01/2023 to slow down disease progression and reduce joint damage.

Despite these interventions, my symptoms continued to impact my daily life significantly. Subsequently, on 05/02/2023, my rheumatologist introduced Prednisone 5mg to control flare-ups and manage acute pain. The combination of Methotrexate and Prednisone proved to be more effective in managing my symptoms, allowing me to function better at work and spend quality time with my family.

Throughout this journey, I consulted with my rheumatologist regularly for follow-up assessments and adjustments to my treatment plan. Their expertise and guidance were essential in optimizing the medications to address my specific needs and improve my overall quality of life. While living with Rheumatoid Arthritis presents its challenges, the tailored medication regimen has been instrumental in managing my symptoms and enhancing my ability to balance work and family responsibilities.
