On May 23, 2021, I started experiencing joint pain, stiffness, and swelling in my hands, which progressively worsened and spread to my knees and feet. Concerned, I visited my primary care physician on June 5, who initially treated me with Ibuprofen 400mg as he suspected it might be due to overwork at the design agency.

As the symptoms persisted, despite the medication, I was referred to a rheumatologist on June 20 for further evaluation. The rheumatologist diagnosed me with Rheumatoid Arthritis after running blood tests and imaging scans, confirming inflammation in my joints. Unfortunately, there was a delay in the diagnosis due to the initial misjudgment of symptoms.

Following the diagnosis, the rheumatologist prescribed a treatment plan. Initially, I was prescribed Methotrexate 15mg weekly to manage the inflammation, which proved to be moderately effective. However, by July 15, due to persistent symptoms, the dosage was increased to 20mg, providing better control over my condition.

In addition to Methotrexate, on August 1, I was also prescribed Naproxen 500mg twice daily to help relieve pain and swelling during flare-ups. Naproxen complemented the Methotrexate therapy well, allowing me to function more comfortably despite the challenging nature of my job.

Throughout this journey, I have consulted with my primary care physician, rheumatologist, and a physical therapist recommended by the rheumatologist to manage the practical aspects of living with Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Combining Methotrexate and Naproxen has significantly improved my symptoms, enabling me to cope with the demands of my profession and maintain an active social life. While the journey with Rheumatoid Arthritis has presented challenges, the prescribed medications have played a crucial role in enhancing my quality of life and managing the condition effectively.
