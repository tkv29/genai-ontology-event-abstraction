On January 19, 2020, I, a 36-year-old single father and construction worker from Moldova, first experienced the debilitating symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis - joint pain, stiffness, and swelling. Initially attributing it to the physical demands of my job, the symptoms persisted, affecting my ability to work and care for my children.

Despite seeking medical help early on, my diagnosis journey was challenging. Misdiagnosed with overexertion and given painkillers, it wasn't until April 2020 that Rheumatoid Arthritis was confirmed through blood tests and imaging, highlighting joint damage that had progressed due to the delays.

Upon diagnosis, my healthcare team prescribed a combination of Methotrexate, Prednisone, and Hydroxychloroquine to manage inflammation and slow disease progression. Methotrexate proved effective in reducing joint pain and swelling, while Prednisone provided rapid relief during flare-ups. Hydroxychloroquine played a key role in maintaining long-term control.

Over the following months, as I adjusted to the medications, regular consultations with rheumatologists and physical therapists became a staple. In October 2020, Azathioprine was added to my regimen to enhance Methotrexate's efficacy, further improving my symptom control and overall quality of life.

Despite the challenges of balancing work, parenthood, and treatment, the prescribed medications significantly alleviated my Rheumatoid Arthritis symptoms, enabling me to continue providing for my family and cherishing moments with my children. The ongoing support from healthcare professionals and the tailored medication plan have been instrumental in helping me navigate life with this chronic condition.
