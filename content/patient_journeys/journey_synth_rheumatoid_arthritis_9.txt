On September 13, 2021, I, a 35-year-old graphic designer from Bosnia and Herzegovina, started experiencing the first signs of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Initially, I noticed morning stiffness in my joints, especially in my hands and knees, which persisted for weeks. As the pain intensified, simple tasks like gripping a pen or walking became excruciating.

Seeking answers, I consulted a general practitioner who suspected a musculoskeletal issue but initially attributed it to overworking due to my busy schedule. However, as my symptoms worsened over the following month, I was referred to a rheumatologist. 

After a series of tests and examinations in late October, the rheumatologist confirmed the diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis. To manage my symptoms effectively, I was prescribed a combination of medications:

- Methotrexate (10mg weekly): This medication proved to be highly effective in reducing inflammation and joint pain. I noticed a significant improvement in my mobility and overall discomfort within a month of starting this medication.

- Prednisone (5mg daily): Initially prescribed as a bridge therapy to control acute symptoms, Prednisone provided rapid relief from pain and swelling. However, its long-term use was tapered down due to potential side effects.

- Hydroxychloroquine (200mg twice daily): This medication helped in managing milder symptoms and contributed to the overall control of the disease progression, enhancing the effectiveness of other medications.

Throughout my journey, I consulted closely with my rheumatologist, who monitored my progress and adjusted the medication dosages as needed to optimize their effectiveness. Although living with Rheumatoid Arthritis has its challenges, the prescribed medications have significantly improved my quality of life, allowing me to continue pursuing my passion for graphic design despite the condition.
