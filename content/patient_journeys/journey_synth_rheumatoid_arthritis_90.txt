On January 29, 2023, I began experiencing joint pain, stiffness, and swelling in multiple areas, which led me to seek medical attention. As a nurse and a single mother, the symptoms quickly took a toll on my ability to work and care for my children. After months of debilitating pain and fatigue, I consulted with my primary care physician, who referred me to a rheumatologist.

The diagnosis process was lengthy and challenging. Initially, my symptoms were attributed to stress and overwork, delaying the proper diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis. It wasn't until June 15, 2023, that I received a confirmed diagnosis after undergoing blood tests, imaging studies, and a physical examination.

Upon diagnosis, my rheumatologist prescribed a combination of medications to manage my symptoms effectively. I was started on Methotrexate combined with Prednisone to control inflammation and disease progression. While Methotrexate helped reduce joint pain and swelling, the side effects were challenging to manage initially.

As my symptoms persisted, my rheumatologist introduced Hydroxychloroquine and Sulfasalazine to further control the disease activity. Hydroxychloroquine was beneficial in improving my overall joint mobility, while Sulfasalazine helped reduce joint inflammation and pain significantly.

Throughout my journey with Rheumatoid Arthritis, I also consulted with a physical therapist to learn exercises that improve joint flexibility and strengthen surrounding muscles. The collaborative effort between my healthcare team, including my rheumatologist, primary care physician, and physical therapist, played a crucial role in managing my condition effectively.

Despite the challenges and adjustments to medications, the treatment plan developed by my healthcare professionals has significantly improved my quality of life. While Rheumatoid Arthritis continues to pose obstacles, the medications prescribed have been instrumental in helping me effectively balance work and family responsibilities.
