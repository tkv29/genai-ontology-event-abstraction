I first experienced symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis on the 1st of July 2020. Initially, I noticed stiffness and swelling in my joints, particularly in my hands and feet, which made it challenging to carry out everyday tasks as a nurse and single mother. The pain gradually worsened over the following weeks, impacting my ability to care for my children and work effectively.

Seeking answers, I consulted my primary care physician who referred me to a rheumatologist. However, the road to diagnosis was not straightforward. There were concerns about possible misdiagnoses due to the overlapping symptoms with other inflammatory conditions. It took several weeks of tests including blood work, imaging studies, and physical examinations before I received a confirmed diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis in mid-August.

The healthcare professionals involved in my care included my primary care physician, rheumatologist, and later a pain management specialist. The treatment plan they established comprised a combination of medications tailored to manage my symptoms effectively. The prescribed medications included Methotrexate to target the underlying cause of inflammation, Hydroxychloroquine to alleviate joint pain, and Prednisone for short-term relief during flare-ups. 

Over the following months, I underwent adjustments to my medication regimen to find the most effective combination. Methotrexate proved beneficial in reducing inflammation and slowing disease progression, while Hydroxychloroquine helped alleviate joint pain and swelling. Prednisone provided quick relief during severe episodes, although long-term use was minimized due to potential side effects.

While managing Rheumatoid Arthritis has posed challenges, the prescribed medications have played a crucial role in improving my quality of life. The support and guidance of my healthcare team have been instrumental in navigating this journey with a focus on finding the right balance of medications to effectively manage my symptoms.
