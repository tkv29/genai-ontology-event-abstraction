On August 4, 2021, as a 35-year-old single mother working as a nurse in San Marino, I started experiencing joint pain, swelling, and stiffness, particularly in my hands and feet. Initially, I attributed it to the physically demanding nature of my job. However, the symptoms persisted and worsened over the next few weeks, making it difficult for me to carry out daily tasks and care for my children.

Concerned about the ongoing discomfort, I sought medical attention. After multiple visits to different healthcare professionals, including rheumatologists and orthopedic surgeons, I was finally diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis on September 15, 2021. The road to diagnosis was challenging, with initial misdiagnoses of overuse injuries delaying the proper identification of my condition.

Following the confirmed diagnosis, I was prescribed a combination of medications to manage my Rheumatoid Arthritis symptoms effectively. Initially, my treatment plan included Ibuprofen for pain relief and Methotrexate to help control the underlying inflammation. While Ibuprofen provided temporary relief, the Methotrexate played a crucial role in reducing the inflammation and slowing disease progression.

As the months progressed, my healthcare team introduced Hydroxychloroquine sulfate to further manage the autoimmune response causing joint damage. This addition significantly improved my symptoms and overall quality of life. Additionally, Prednisone was occasionally prescribed during flare-ups to provide additional relief from severe pain and inflammation.

Through regular consultations with my rheumatologist and other specialists, we adjusted the medication dosages and combinations to find the most effective regimen for my condition. The collaborative efforts of my healthcare professionals and the tailored medication plan have been instrumental in controlling my Rheumatoid Arthritis symptoms, allowing me to continue my work as a nurse and care for my children with reduced discomfort and improved mobility.
