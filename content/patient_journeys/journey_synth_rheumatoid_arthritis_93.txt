On June 29, 2023, I, a 35-year-old graphic designer from Slovenia, began experiencing the first symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Initially, I noticed persistent joint pain in my hands and feet, accompanied by morning stiffness that lasted for more than an hour. As the weeks went by, the pain intensified, affecting my ability to work and engage in activities with my family.

Seeking answers, I consulted my primary care physician, who referred me to a rheumatologist. The process of getting a confirmed diagnosis was challenging, with some doctors initially attributing my symptoms to overexertion or stress. After numerous appointments and tests, I finally received a definitive diagnosis on August 15, 2023.

Upon diagnosis, my rheumatologist prescribed a combination of medications to manage my Rheumatoid Arthritis symptoms effectively. I started with Naproxen 500mg twice daily, which helped alleviate the pain and reduce inflammation in my joints. However, the side effects of Naproxen, such as gastrointestinal discomfort, prompted a switch to Meloxicam 15mg daily on September 10, 2023. Meloxicam proved to be more tolerable and provided sustained relief.

As my condition progressed, my rheumatologist introduced Methotrexate 10mg weekly on October 5, 2023, to slow down the progression of joint damage. While initially experiencing some mild side effects like nausea and fatigue, the long-term benefits of Methotrexate in controlling inflammation were significant. Additionally, I was prescribed Prednisone 5mg daily during flare-ups to manage acute symptoms effectively.

Throughout my journey with Rheumatoid Arthritis, I consulted with my rheumatologist regularly, undergoing periodic assessments to monitor my response to the medications and make necessary adjustments. With the support of my healthcare team and the prescribed medications, I have been able to maintain a balance between my professional responsibilities as a graphic designer and my roles as a husband and father, finding relief and managing my symptoms effectively.
