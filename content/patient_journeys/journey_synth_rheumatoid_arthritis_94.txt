I first noticed the initial symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis on November 9th, 2022. It began with persistent joint pain in my hands and feet, accompanied by swelling and stiffness, making it challenging to perform everyday tasks. The pain gradually worsened, affecting my work as an accountant and my time with my family.

Seeking answers, I visited my primary care physician on November 15th, 2022. After blood tests and a physical examination, Rheumatoid Arthritis was suspected. However, due to the complexity of the diagnosis, it took until December 3rd, 2022, to receive a confirmed diagnosis after consulting with a rheumatologist.

Upon diagnosis, I was prescribed a combination of medications to manage my symptoms. Initially, I started with Ibuprofen 200mg to alleviate pain and inflammation. While it provided some relief, the effectiveness decreased over time.

In January 2023, my rheumatologist introduced Methotrexate to help slow down the progression of the disease. This medication significantly improved my condition, reducing joint pain and swelling. However, it came with side effects like nausea and fatigue.

As the symptoms persisted, Leflunomide was added to my treatment regimen in March 2023. This medication helped further reduce inflammation, allowing me to function more comfortably. I also received regular steroid injections to target severe flare-ups.

Throughout my journey, I consulted with my primary care physician, rheumatologist, and a physical therapist to monitor my progress and adjust the treatment plan accordingly. Although managing Rheumatoid Arthritis has been challenging, the prescribed medications have played a crucial role in enhancing my quality of life, allowing me to continue working and pursuing my passion for photography.
