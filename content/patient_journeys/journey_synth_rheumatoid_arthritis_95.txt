The initial symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis started creeping in on September 29, 2020, with persistent joint pain and swelling in my fingers and toes. As a 35-year-old graphic designer and single parent, these symptoms significantly impacted my ability to work and care for my children effectively.

After weeks of enduring the increasing discomfort, I consulted a rheumatologist on October 15, 2020. The diagnostic process involved blood tests, imaging scans, and a physical examination. Unfortunately, there were some delays due to the complexity of diagnosing autoimmune conditions like RA, and initially, my symptoms were mistaken for general joint pain.

Finally, on November 10, 2020, I received the official diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis. The rheumatologist prescribed a combination of medications to manage my symptoms and slow down the progression of the disease. 

The medications prescribed for managing my Rheumatoid Arthritis include:
- Methotrexate: Started on November 15, 2020, this medication has been effective in reducing joint inflammation and pain.
- Prednisone: Initially used for quick relief of severe symptoms, this medication was effective but caused some bothersome side effects.
- Hydroxychloroquine sulfate: Prescribed on December 5, 2020, this medication has played a vital role in managing my RA symptoms, especially in combination with Methotrexate.

Throughout this journey, I consulted with rheumatologists, general practitioners, and physiotherapists to ensure holistic management of my condition. The medications have been instrumental in alleviating my pain and improving my quality of life, allowing me to continue pursuing my passion for creativity amidst the challenges posed by Rheumatoid Arthritis.
