On October 27, 2020, I, a 35-year-old police officer from Moldova, started experiencing the initial symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis. It began with joint pain, stiffness, and swelling in my hands and knees, making it challenging to perform my duties effectively. These symptoms progressed rapidly over the next few weeks, impacting my ability to work and engage in family activities.

Seeking answers, I visited my primary care physician in November 2020. Initially, my symptoms were attributed to overexertion due to my demanding job. However, as the pain persisted, I was referred to a rheumatologist in December 2020. After a series of tests, including blood work and imaging, I received a confirmed diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis in January 2021.

The rheumatologist prescribed a combination of medications to manage my symptoms. Initially, I was prescribed Ibuprofen 200mg three times a day for pain relief, which provided moderate relief but was not sufficient to control the inflammation. In February 2021, my treatment was escalated to include Methotrexate 10mg weekly, which helped reduce joint swelling and pain significantly.

As my condition continued to progress, in March 2021, the rheumatologist added Prednisone 5mg daily to alleviate flare-ups. This combination of Methotrexate and Prednisone proved to be more effective in managing my Rheumatoid Arthritis symptoms, allowing me to continue working and spending quality time with my family.

Throughout my journey, I consulted with my rheumatologist regularly for medication adjustments and monitoring of my condition. The healthcare professionals I worked with played a crucial role in helping me navigate the complexities of Rheumatoid Arthritis treatment, ultimately improving my quality of life despite the challenges posed by the condition.
