On August 18, 2021, I, a 35-year-old stay-at-home mom from Turkey, first experienced symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Initially, I noticed joint stiffness, swelling, and fatigue, which gradually worsened over the following weeks, affecting my ability to carry out daily tasks like cooking and playing with my children.

The process of getting diagnosed was challenging. Initially, my symptoms were dismissed as regular fatigue from household duties, causing a delay in seeking medical help. However, persistent joint pain led me to consult with a rheumatologist in September 2021, who confirmed the diagnosis after thorough tests ruled out other conditions.

Upon diagnosis, a comprehensive medication regimen was prescribed to manage my Rheumatoid Arthritis symptoms effectively. Initially, I was started on Naproxen 250mg twice daily, which provided some relief from joint pain. However, as the disease progressed, Methotrexate was added to my treatment plan in October 2021. This combination significantly improved my symptoms and allowed me to better manage my daily activities.

Throughout my journey, I regularly consulted with my rheumatologist for medication adjustments and monitoring of disease progression. The healthcare professionals played a crucial role in understanding the impact of each medication on my symptoms and adjusting the treatment plan accordingly.

In summary, the combination of Naproxen and Methotrexate has been effective in managing my Rheumatoid Arthritis symptoms, allowing me to lead a more functional and less painful life. The support and expertise of my healthcare team have been invaluable in navigating this condition and optimizing my treatment plan.
