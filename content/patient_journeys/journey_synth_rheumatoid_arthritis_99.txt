On 21/03/2023, I, a 35-year-old software engineer from Poland, began experiencing joint pain, stiffness, and fatigue, which gradually worsened over a few weeks. Balancing a demanding job and family responsibilities, I initially attributed these symptoms to stress. However, as the pain intensified and affected my daily activities, I sought medical help.

After consulting my primary care physician on 15/04/2023, I was referred to a rheumatologist. Due to a shortage of specialists, I faced a delay in getting an appointment, causing frustration and uncertainty. In the meantime, the pain became unbearable, impacting both work and time with my family.

Finally, on 10/05/2023, I saw the rheumatologist who diagnosed me with Rheumatoid Arthritis after thorough examinations and tests. The relief of having an answer was tempered by the overwhelming prospect of long-term management.

The prescribed treatment plan included Methotrexate, starting with 10mg weekly, to manage inflammation and slow disease progression. Initially, the side effects were challenging, but they subsided over time, and Methotrexate proved effective in reducing joint pain and swelling.

In addition to Methotrexate, my rheumatologist introduced Hydroxychloroquine sulfate on 01/06/2023 to complement the primary treatment. The combination enhanced the control of inflammation, allowing me to better manage work responsibilities and enjoy quality time with my family.

Regular follow-ups with the rheumatologist ensured adjustments in medication dosages to optimize efficacy while minimizing side effects. The journey with Rheumatoid Arthritis has been a learning experience, emphasizing the importance of medication adherence and proactive communication with healthcare professionals.

Overall, the prescribed medications, Methotrexate and Hydroxychloroquine sulfate, have significantly improved my symptoms and quality of life. Despite the initial challenges, I find solace in the relief they provide, enabling me to navigate the complexities of living with Rheumatoid Arthritis while cherishing moments with my loved ones.
