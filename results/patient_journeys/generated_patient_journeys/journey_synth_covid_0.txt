After experiencing my first symptoms of Covid-19 on 07/06/2022, I took immediate action and informed my workplace at the hospital. Following the protocol, I got tested, and it came back positive on the same day. Despite feeling unwell, I isolated myself at home to protect my two young children. Over the next few days, my symptoms worsened, and I developed a persistent cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.

I consulted with my primary care physician via telemedicine regularly to update them on my condition. They advised me to monitor my oxygen levels, stay hydrated, and get enough rest. As the week progressed, I struggled with balancing rest and caring for my children, relying on help from friends and family for essential errands and childcare.

By the second week of my infection, my symptoms began to improve, and I started to regain my energy. I continued to follow up with my doctor to ensure a full recovery and discussed the possibility of getting vaccinated once fully recovered. After consulting with healthcare professionals and considering my job as a nurse, I decided to get vaccinated to protect myself and others from future infections.

I received my first vaccine dose the month after recovering from Covid-19 and completed the full vaccination course according to the recommended schedule. Throughout this challenging period, I remained grateful for the support of my loved ones and coworkers, who helped me navigate the difficulties of being a single mother and healthcare worker during a global pandemic.
