Initial Symptoms: It all began with persistent joint pain in my hands and feet, accompanied by stiffness that worsened in the mornings. As a busy nurse and mother, I initially dismissed these symptoms as signs of fatigue from my hectic schedule.

Diagnosis Process: However, as the pain intensified over a few weeks and started affecting my daily tasks, I consulted my primary care physician. After blood tests and imaging, I was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis on 07/07/2021. There were no misdiagnoses, but the process felt prolonged due to my reluctance to prioritize my health over work and family commitments.

Medications Prescribed:
1. Methotrexate (08/07/2021): This DMARD was my first line of treatment. It took a few weeks to notice significant improvement, but it effectively reduced my joint pain and swelling.
2. Prednisone (14/08/2021): Prescribed during a flare-up, it provided quick relief but caused temporary insomnia and mood swings.
3. Hydroxychloroquine (25/09/2021): Added to my regimen to manage inflammation. Took about a month to show noticeable effects in conjunction with Methotrexate.
4. Adalimumab (03/11/2021): A biologic drug introduced when other medications didn't provide sufficient relief. It significantly improved my symptoms, allowing me to manage work and family responsibilities more effectively.

Healthcare Professionals: I consulted a rheumatologist for the diagnosis and ongoing management of my Rheumatoid Arthritis. Their expertise and regular monitoring have been crucial in adjusting medication dosages and combinations to find what works best for my specific case.

Overall, the journey with Rheumatoid Arthritis has been challenging, but with the right medications and support from healthcare providers, I've been able to find a balance that allows me to continue my work as a nurse and be present for my loved ones.
