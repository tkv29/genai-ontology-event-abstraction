At 38, as a software engineer from Denmark, I began experiencing troubling symptoms like joint pain and stiffness starting in November 2021. Initially dismissing them as overwork, the persistence and intensity led me to seek medical help in December. After blood tests, scans, and consultations with rheumatologists, I was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis in January. 

The journey to finding effective medication was challenging. Initially prescribed nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen to manage pain and inflammation, they provided limited relief. As the disease progressed, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) such as methotrexate were introduced in February to slow joint damage and reduce symptoms. Although these DMARDs took time to show their full effect, I began noticing improvements in joint pain and stiffness within a few months.

Despite the positive response to methotrexate, ongoing joint issues prompted the addition of biologic DMARDs like adalimumab in April to target specific components of the immune system contributing to inflammation. Combining these medications improved my quality of life significantly, allowing me to manage my demanding job and enjoy time with my family without being overwhelmed by RA symptoms.

Throughout this journey, I consulted with rheumatologists, general practitioners, and physiotherapists, each playing a crucial role in my treatment plan and overall well-being. Their expertise, coupled with the tailored medication regimen, helped me regain control over my Rheumatoid Arthritis and maintain a fulfilling life despite the challenges posed by this chronic condition.
