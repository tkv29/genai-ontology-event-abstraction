As a 35-year-old nurse from Finland, my journey with Rheumatoid Arthritis began on June 5, 2020, when I first noticed persistent joint pain and stiffness in my hands and wrists. Initially, I attributed these symptoms to my demanding work schedule, but as they worsened over the following weeks, I realized something more serious might be at play.

Seeking medical advice, I consulted my primary care physician in late June, who referred me to a rheumatologist for further evaluation. The process of getting diagnosed was challenging, with initial tests pointing towards other autoimmune conditions before the definitive diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis was confirmed in mid-July.

After the diagnosis, my rheumatologist prescribed a combination of medications to manage my symptoms and prevent disease progression. The initial treatment plan included Methotrexate, a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD), to help control inflammation and joint damage. While Methotrexate effectively reduced my symptoms, I experienced nausea and fatigue as temporary side effects.

As my condition required more aggressive treatment, my rheumatologist introduced biologic DMARDs like Adalimumab to target specific components of the immune system responsible for Rheumatoid Arthritis. The addition of Adalimumab significantly improved my quality of life, reducing inflammation and pain in my joints.

Throughout my journey, I consulted with a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals, including rheumatologists, nurses, and physiotherapists, who played a crucial role in monitoring my progress and adjusting treatment plans as needed.

Despite the challenges of balancing work and family life, the medications prescribed for managing my Rheumatoid Arthritis have been instrumental in allowing me to continue my nursing career and care for my loved ones. With ongoing support from my healthcare providers and the effectiveness of the prescribed medications, I strive to maintain a balance between managing my condition and pursuing my passion for helping others.
